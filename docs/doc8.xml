              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="243609" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Skills and Training</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:02</span>):  This week is National Skills Week. It's a week that celebrates the vocational education and training sector. This year's theme is 'VET – It's a game changer!' VET is front and centre when it comes to solving big national challenges in the labour market, like what it means for the transition to net zero emissions or supporting growth in early education and in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is restoring and revitalising the VET sector to meet the significant workforce challenges we face while also shining a light on gender equity and on closing the gap. Unfortunately, there was a wasted decade of neglect that preceded us, characterised by a failure to work with others, like state and territory governments, and looking the other way when it came to promoting quality training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our work started by putting TAFE back at the heart of Australia's vocational education and training sector. TAFE is vital for the next generation of skilled workers. For too long students studied courses or undertook training that did not lead to a secure job or to skills that employers needed. Jobs and Skills Australia, the body established by this government to provide independent advice on workforce, skills and training needs, quickly identified that we must address the disconnect between what students are studying now and where jobs and skills of the future will be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobs and Skills Australia's research in workforce capacity studies and employment projections shows us the plain facts of the challenge that is before us. Ninety per cent of jobs growth in the next 10 years will require post-secondary education; 44 per cent of these jobs will require a VET qualification—nearly half. But, at the same time, the number of people with a certificate I to IV has been growing far slower than those reporting a bachelor's degree. National Skills Week seeks to raise the perception and profile of vocational learning. We must showcase all of the opportunities available to Australians looking for their dream career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today people are in a much stronger position to grasp these opportunities thanks to the actions taken by the Albanese Labor government. We've tackled the key problem of cost. Fee-free TAFE is critical to removing the cost barriers to people undertaking training across the country. In partnership with states and territories, fee-free TAFE has exceeded all expectations. Over half a million Australians have enrolled in courses of high skills demand since 1 January last year. A few weeks ago I met a young woman on her third day studying to be an early childhood educator at Melbourne Polytechnic. Because it is fee free, she can look after herself at the same time as studying to get a job in one of the most important industries in the country: caring for and educating our children. She was so excited to be able to give back in this new career. What could be better than this?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In New South Wales alone there have been over 224,000 enrolments in fee-free TAFE. Fee-free TAFE is also supporting disadvantaged and in-need Australians: 155,000 young people, 117,000 jobseekers, around 35,000 people with disability and over 26,000 First Nations Australians have enrolled in fee-free TAFE. Women make up the large majority—around 63 per cent—of enrolments, with nearly 300,000 women taking on a qualification under this program. Around 166,000 enrolments—more than a third—are in regional and remote locations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to fee-free TAFE, the Albanese government has signed a landmark National Skills Agreement with states and territories. This is the framework we need to address both national problems and state and territory priorities. This is something that is expanding and transforming access to the VET sector, supporting quality training and implementing reforms to address critical skills needs. It will unlock up to $30 billion in investment in the VET sector over five years. It's a significant shift away from the short-term transactional working relationships of the past decade. It will ensure that Commonwealth funding is used more effectively to achieve opportunities for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, under the National Skills Agreement we're creating 20 TAFE centres of excellence to grow strategically important industries, including a focus on digital skills. These centres of excellence will bring together tertiary centres, employers and unions. The TAFE Technology Fund is upgrading and expanding neglected TAFE facilities across the country, such as laboratories, workshops and IT services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And you can't have quality VET without workforce. Under the National Skills Agreement, measures to strengthen the VET workforce will be identified in the VET Workforce Blueprint, as agreed with the states and territories. We're also responding to the Universities Accord to drive greater alignment and collaboration between VET and higher education. Improving tertiary collaboration will prepare the groundwork for broader reform. This includes reform to provide better credit recognition between VET and higher education and exploration of ways to improve regulatory approaches for dual sector providers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The way we work together with others is central to the Albanese government's approach. We bring people together. We've established 10 jobs and skills councils to provide industry with a stronger voice to ensure that Australia's vocational education and training sector delivers better outcomes for both learners and employers in priority areas. Employers and unions are working in partnership with governments and training providers to tackle workforce challenges together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To achieve ambitious housing targets, we're also investing in the housing and construction workforce through the Skilling the Construction Workforce to Support Housing Supply measure. And we can't deliver a pipeline of skilled workers if apprentices don't finish their training. So we're investing in additional targeted support under the Australian Apprenticeships Incentive System to help apprentices complete their training. I'm eagerly awaiting the strategic review of the Apprenticeships Incentive System, led by the Hon. Justice Iain Ross AO and Lisa Paul AO.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also taking action to lift quality and integrity across the VET sector, including through the regulator, ASQA. We've provided ASQA with stronger powers to tackle non-genuine or unscrupulous RTOs operating or seeking to operate in the VET sector. Evidence of this was seen just this week, with 150 dormant vocational education and training providers, or ghost colleges, that failed to show proof of delivering training for 12 months or more shut down and 140 placed on a watchlist. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A high-performing, world-class VET sector is crucial for achieving a fairer society and a stronger economy, and we are building a stronger, more equitable vocational education and training sector so that we can help Australians build a future that is made in Australia.</span>

Some may know that, as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I get to pick my portfolio, and I picked skills because I understand that skills is a critical area of policy for the future of our nation and for the future of our young people. When I finished school, I couldn't think of anything worse than sitting in an office, so I went to my local training provider and pursued a vocational qualification in flying. It changed my life. That is why I love skills. There is nothing more motivating than meeting the next generation of workers who are either on the tools on a worksite or in a TAFE or in school classrooms.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That quote could have been lifted straight out of the pages of any newspaper today, but they are not my words. They are the words of the Howard government in 2004. Twenty years on, the stigma of vocational education and the cultural imbalance with university remains. We have to change that stigma, and National Skills Week is a part of that effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said before, the reality is that Australia will face a forever skills shortage unless we look at long-term reform that supports more Australians to get into skills earlier in their lives. With the rise of artificial intelligence, I think we need to be honest with our young people. A university degree is not the sure bet it once was. If you want real job security, a trade today is perhaps your safest bet. So, this National Skills Week, I want all Australians to think about how we make the big changes we need to get more young people to buy into vocational education. I welcome the comments made by the jobs and skills commissioner, Barney Glover, at the Press Club, highlighting that we need to have a stronger focus on post-16 training rather than just post-school training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been saying for some time now that I think we need to have a national conversation about getting skills back into schools. According to the official data released in recent weeks, just 19,310 students were undertaking school based apprenticeships or traineeships, and that is down seven per cent from 2022. We are going backwards. Out of the 1.6 million secondary students across Australia, just one per cent are undertaking school based apprenticeships or traineeships. The truth is that we have taken skills out of schools, and we need to look at how to bring them back in. We do not have a pipeline of skills in schools that can boost our manufacturers and construction workforce or develop the critical skills we need to support strategic efforts like AUKUS and nuclear energy. In Germany, they have skills in schools, and 50 per cent of all German school leavers undertake vocational training. In France, another global manufacturing nation, they have skills in schools, with around 23 per cent of students moving into upper secondary education entering a vocational high school. This Skills Week, I ask everyone across the sector to really look at structural ways of lifting the status of vocational training and the pipeline of skilled workers and bring them forward. I want to hear your views.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to take this opportunity to formally welcome the new Minister for Skills and Training to his post, and I have wished his predecessor, the member for Gorton, well. Like his predecessor, he too chose the university route to post-school learning. That is okay, but I would just warn him to remain mindful of the fact that many on this side of the House, including me, have spent time in these training institutions as students, as trainers and as operators before he tries to throw stones at the coalition in his new role. Credibility is everything in this business, and Slater and Gordon isn't known for building houses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've made a fair bit of commentary about the new minister for skills, and I'm pushing him because I want him to lift his game. I'm not going to allow underperformance in this vital portfolio. So this National Skills Week, the new minister has some serious questions to answer. I note he hasn't fronted the media yet but just given a few controlled speeches, like today. I would urge him to stick his head up out of the talking points and front some journalists soon. When he does, the test for this minister is to explain exactly how many of those fee-free TAFE courses have actually resulted in a qualification.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor likes to claim they have delivered 500,000 fee-free TAFE places, but how many have delivered a skilled worker? Estimates of TAFE completions indicate the failure or non-completion rate could be as high as 55 to 60 per cent across these courses. Some in the training sector have indicated some courses could have rates as high as 70 to 90 per cent of noncompletion. In Victoria, just one per cent of those who registered for a free certificate IV in plumbing successfully completed their training. So I call on the minister to confirm exactly how many of Labor's 500,000 fee-free TAFE courses have resulted in a real qualification being completed and delivered to a newly qualified worker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not make these requests to talk down TAFE—I am a big supporter of TAFE—but I do it because we have invested a great deal of money in this program and Australians expect results. Given taxpayers have invested $1.5 billion in this program, Minister Giles must provide a comprehensive update on Labor's fee-free TAFE program, including how many cancellations or noncompletions there have been across the 500,000 enrolments. This National Skills Week we must also have an honest conversation about the state of Aussie skills. The latest data released by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research confirms Australia has lost over 85,300 apprentices and trainees from the national training pipeline since the Albanese government took office—a loss of one in five.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade apprentices in training hit record highs in the final months of the coalition government, and, as of June 2022, there were 429,000 apprentices and trainees in training and 277,900 commencements. The latest data shows apprentices and trainees in training dropped to 343,640 in December 2023.</span>

                  </a>  In conclusion, I hope this National Skills Week we see a turning point. Who knows, this new minister may just be up for it, but time will tell. I will be watching closely. I do wish this minister well in his new role, and I want him to succeed. Australians are counting on him to step up. We all want to see the Australian skills system get back on track, and this National Skills Week I want to thank everyone who is working so hard to do just that.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">The SPEAKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">09:19</span>):  I'm pleased to present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United States of America which took place from 7 July to 16 July this year. As leader of this delegation, I'd first like to thank the other members of the delegation for their contribution to the visit: the Leader of the Nationals, the Deputy Speaker, the Chief Government Whip and the Chief Opposition Whip. The delegation worked well together and brought a variety of interests and knowledge of issues, which proved to be very valuable during our meetings and discussions. The delegation had extensive programs in Washington as well as elements in New York and Dallas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank His Excellency the Hon. Dr. Kevin Rudd AC, Australian Ambassador to the United States of America, Ms Heather Ridout AO, Australian Consul-General in New York, and Mr Ned Talbot, Australian Deputy Consul-General in Houston, as well as their staff, for the valuable briefings and support they provided to the delegation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The major aim of the delegation was to participate in the Australian American Leadership Dialogue, as well as to strengthen relations between the Australian parliament and the United States Congress; to discuss economic and trade links between Australia and the US; and to discuss issues of common interest and concern, including the AUKUS partnership and defence cooperation. We held productive discussions with parliamentarians, senior government officials, business leaders and academics. We were also privileged to visit the United States Congress, as well as Newport News shipyard in Virginia and the Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter production facility in Dallas. This report details all of the meetings and visits the delegation had and the various matters discussed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A highlight for the delegation was our participation in the 2024 Australian American Leadership Dialogue, held in Washington, DC. The AALD brings together Australian and American leaders from government, enterprise, space and technology, media, education and the community to help review and refine the parameters of the Australian-American bilateral relationship. First held in 1993, the dialogue allows a rich and ongoing exchange of ideas across a range of themes, including economics and trade, security and defence, foreign policy, innovation, technology, energy and climate, health, cybersecurity and emerging social issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the delegation, I would like to record our appreciation for the hard work that went into preparing for the visit, including the arrangements by staff of the International and Parliamentary Relations Office, and material provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I commend this report to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a Labor government who introduced our country's first maternity allowance back in 1912. It was a Labor government who created Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Labor governments delivered no-fault divorce, the single mothers benefit and the child support system. And it was a Labor government—the Gillard government—that introduced paid parental leave in this country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When paid parental leave was introduced in 2011, it was a major milestone for Australian families. As the Minister for Families, the Hon.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, earlier this year, we passed legislation to increase the length of the scheme. From 1 July 2024, we added two more weeks of payment, expanding the scheme from 20 weeks to 22 weeks.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All these changes combined mean paid parental leave is now more accessible, flexible and it encourages shared care. It supports parents to take a step back from paid work and provides critical financial support at such an important time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through paid parental leave, the government supports parents to take time off work after the birth or adoption of their child. Through this bill, we are taking action to support them at retirement as well.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this bill, we are investing $1.1 billion over the forward estimates to pay superannuation on government paid parental leave from July 2025.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Women make up the majority of primary caregivers in this country, leading to what has been referred to as 'the motherhood penalty', where they face greater economic insecurity because of time out of the workforce to care for children.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of lower income compounds over time, increasing the gap between men's and women's superannuation balances at retirement. The data is clear—women retire with around 25 per cent less super than men. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For babies born or adopted from 1 July 2025, this bill delivers all eligible parents with an additional 12 per cent of their paid parental leave as a contribution directly to their super fund.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This super contribution will match the superannuation guarantee rate as at 1 July of the financial year the PPL is taken. It will rise with any future increases to the legislated superannuation guarantee.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contribution will be made annually by the Australian tax office after the end of each financial year. It will include an additional interest component to address any forgone superannuation fund earnings as a result of the payment not being made more regularly.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most parents won't need to do anything further to receive their superannuation payment and the claim process for paid parental leave will not change.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 180,000 families will benefit from the changes. Once the Paid Parental Leave scheme reaches 26 weeks in 2026, and based on a superannuation guarantee rate of 12 per cent, the maximum amount a family would receive in superannuation contributions is around $3,000.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, and our two other paid parental leave laws before it, send a clear message that the government is committed to a stronger parental leave system, and we want to see this reinforced throughout workplaces.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Paying super on government funded paid parental leave will continue to normalise parental leave as a workplace entitlement, like annual and sick leave.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This positive trend demonstrates employers increasingly see themselves as having a role alongside government in providing paid parental leave.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, when businesses offer their own employer-funded paid parental leave entitlements, it is a major way to attract and retain staff.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we encourage employers to do this, this bill is about strengthening the government scheme.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to adding super to the government payment, this bill will ensure the parental leave framework in the Fair Work Act complements the Paid Parental Leave scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unpaid parental leave in the Fair Work Act is an entitlement that supports parents to remain connected to paid employment while they care for their child.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill includes minor technical amendments to clarify drafting to ensure that parents can access 'keeping in touch days' during a period of continuous unpaid parental leave to remain in contact with their workplace and help facilitate their return to work.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Law Amendment Bill 2024 builds on the landmark reforms to Australia's family law system that were passed in 2023. Together these important reforms demonstrate the government's ongoing commitment to ensuring that the Australian family law system is safer, more accessible and simpler to use and delivers justice and equity for all Australian families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent inquiries, including the 2019 Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry and the 2021 parliamentary joint select committee inquiry, have highlighted ongoing challenges in the family law system. It is complex and confusing. It fails to respond effectively to family violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes a range of amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 to address recommendations from these recent family law inquiries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where the family law reforms of 2023 focused principally on safety and clarity in parenting orders, the key amendments in this bill make resolving property and financial aspects of relationship breakdown safer, simpler and fairer for separating families. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the bill implements improvements to the legal frameworks underpinning property settlements and spousal maintenance matters, including to specifically recognise the economic impact of family violence on the wealth and welfare of Australian families. The bill also makes the family law system safer and simpler by including amendments to enhance the operation of Children's Contact Services, clarifying important aspects of family law, safeguarding sensitive information in family law proceedings, including specific factors for decisions about family pets, and supporting the effective operation of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes significant changes to parts VIII and part VIIIAB of the Family Law Act, which relate to property and financial proceedings for married and de facto couples, respectively. The effective operation of these parts of the Family Law Act is critical to ensuring financial arrangements following relationship breakdown are resolved safely, and on just and equitable terms. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will codify the steps in the decision-making framework for property settlements, making the law clearer and more accessible for users of the Family Law Act. The Family Law Act does not currently identify the steps a court takes before making a property settlement order. This can be an obstacle to separating couples seeking to negotiate their own settlement, because they may not understand what the court considers in reaching an outcome. The law relating to property settlement must be clear and easy to understand for all users of the system.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has consulted with the public and with key family law stakeholders. In response, this bill will amend the Family Law Act to ensure that it operates in a way that assists separating couples to better understand and more easily and safely navigate the division of their property, both within and outside the court system. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will ensure the economic impact of family violence on the wealth and welfare of Australian families is considered in property settlements where relevant. The government considers that all forms of family violence are unacceptable and is committed to addressing the economic consequences of family violence on separated families. Family violence is a critical and far too common issue in the community. Women are victims of family violence from a current of former partner at significantly higher rates than men. First Nations women, in particular, are disproportionately impacted by family violence. They are 33 times more likely to be hospitalised due to violence than non-Indigenous women and six times more likely to die as a result of family violence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Women are also more likely to experience financial difficulties after separation and face a higher risk of poverty than men. This is particularly the case where there is family violence involved, with research indicating that victims of family violence struggle to achieve a fair division of property under the Family Law Act, and may suffer long-term financial disadvantage. For any children involved, in addition to the trauma of exposure to family violence, they may also then face financial insecurity and housing instability as a result of an inequitable outcome for their primary carer in a property settlement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Law Act does not currently identify family violence as a relevant matter for the court to consider in a property settlement. This has been left to common law principles in case law, which are difficult to find, understand and keep up with. There has been a high evidentiary threshold for establishing the relevance and impact of the violence, and limited evidence that the principles result in a meaningful adjustment to the distribution of property in a victim-survivor's favour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes amendments to explicitly allow the court to consider the effect of family violence on the parties' ability to contribute to the property pool of a relationship, and to consider the effect of family violence on their future needs. This may be considered by the court along with a range of other factors to inform its decision about dividing property and finances. The effect of family violence can also be considered by the court in determining an application for spousal maintenance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill sends a strong message to the community that property settlement outcomes should recognise the effect of family violence on individuals, and on the wealth and welfare of the family, where this is relevant. It makes clear to the family law courts, and parties negotiating outside of court, that the economic consequences of family violence are relevant to resolving property and financial aspects of relationship breakdown. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will introduce a duty of disclosure for property and financial matters into the Family Law Act.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will make the less adversarial trial approach available in property and other non-child-related proceedings. The less adversarial trial enables the court to actively manage the conduct of the proceedings, including directing how and on what issues evidence is brought forward and dealt with. Extending this beyond child-focused proceedings will support parties to raise family violence risks in property and other proceedings, ensuring they are safe and these issues are managed effectively throughout the proceedings. It will also support those seeking to raise the economic effect of family violence as a factor relevant to determining their property or spousal maintenance matter to bring forward evidence of family violence and its effects. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill proposes amendments that will apply particular considerations to pets—defined as 'companion animals'—in determining the ownership of the pet as part of a property settlement. This will allow a court to make orders giving ownership of a pet to one party following a relationship breakdown. In making such an order, the court will be able to consider factors such as any history of family violence during the relationship, the extent to which each party has cared for the animal, any history of cruelty to the pet by a party, and the relationships of a party or a child with the pet. This will help recognise pets as a unique type of property that deserves special considerations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While these records will often contain information relevant to proceedings, the experience of having private medical records or counselling notes made available to the other party is traumatic and distressing for many litigants. Seeking to have sensitive information disclosed and adduced in family law proceedings is also a method that can be employed by perpetrators to exploit legal systems to continue their abuse of an ex-partner. </span>

The project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 15 May 2024. Following its inquiry, the committee recommended that the House of Representatives resolved that it is expedient to carry out the proposed works. The committee also recommended that the Department of Finance consult with the Australian Federal Police immediately regarding the security aspects of the fit-out design for the proposed works and at a much earlier stage for any Commonwealth parliament office fit-out works in the future.

The Australian Federal Police will be included in any future Commonwealth parliament office fit-out works as recommended by the committee.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:08</span>):  Last night, when I was talking to the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024, we were interrupted. I was making the point at the time that we were interrupted that the idea of Australian made is a mark of quality. We remember that great campaign with the green triangular logo with the kangaroo on it. We see Australian made as a mark of quality. We know it to be a thing of trust. This bill takes that brand, but it's not a bill we can trust. The government has sought to appropriate the sentiment with branding this policy, but it's really all just spin. In short, the government's so-called Future Made in Australia Bill is an exercise in political pork-barrelling and one which will further drive up the cost of living with more corporate welfare and more handouts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the outset, I want to make it clear that Australia is a great manufacturing nation. We've got a proud manufacturing history. We on this side of the House have always and will always support manufacturing, but that's not what we're talking about with this bill. This bill establishes a slush fund because it establishes a pot of taxpayers' money to allow the minister to spend as he wishes. Some will say that this bill is about climate change. Of course, we need to tackle climate change. The coalition has a plan to reduce emissions, but this bill from the Labor Party has nothing to do with that. This is about Labor looking after their mates rather than the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen with this bill is Labor failing to address the cost of living. As I said last night, this bill is adding more government spending to the economy at a time when orthodox economics indicates that government should be restraining spending, not spending more. We are seeing Labor make bad policy decisions that are making the cost of living even worse. The cost of groceries is up. The cost of electricity is up. The cost of gas is up. The cost of petrol is up. Rents and mortgages are going through the roof, climbing higher and higher. Labor has lost control of its spending, and people in my electorate are paying for it. That is why we are going to oppose this bill. The more we hear about it, the more we know the plan doesn't stack up. This is a plan for pork-barrelling. It is not a plan for a strong economy. This is a plan for more government, not more investment in businesses. It is a plan for more inflation at a time when Labor's spending is already making things worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's policies on energy, industrial relations and tax are all making Australia a less attractive place to do business. The facts are clear: insolvencies are up, productivity is down and businesses are struggling. Economist after economist has criticised this policy. When you have someone of the standing of Danielle Wood, the government's own hand-picked head of the Productivity Commission, an economist of great standing, who has been so critical of this bill—and I will come back to Danielle Wood in a moment—it should be a red light and a red flag that this bill shouldn't proceed. This is a slogan in search of a policy. It is really about the Prime Minister trying to pick winners. It is not about orthodox economic policy and, in the end, Australian families will lose out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is at the back end of the pack when it comes to fighting inflation compared to so many of the countries across the G10. We are in an entrenched GDP-per-capita recession, with anaemic economic growth, which means household are going backwards. I mentioned insolvencies before. Around 19,000 business have entered insolvencies since Labor came to office. That's the highest on record since ASIC began collecting that data. Behind each of those insolvencies is the story of a family, the story of somebody who has tried to have a go and put everything on the line and yet their business has gone bust. Why has it gone bust? In part, it's because of the economic conditions that have been in place due to Labor. Since Labor came into power, prices are up by 10 per cent for households. Personal income tax rates are up by 20 per cent. Real wages for employees have collapsed by nine per cent. Living standards have collapsed by eight per cent. Household savings are down 10 per cent. A family with a typical mortgage of $750,000 is $35,000 worse off. This bill does nothing to help households that are struggling. It does nothing to take pressure off families and small business. In fact, as I have said before, the big spending agenda here is likely to make inflation much worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the centre of the bill is the establishment of a fund for the government to pick winners. It's economics 101. We know it's been tried in the past and we know that, when governments pick winners, it never works. You are much better off leaving these matters of where investment should go to the market. It is not just the coalition saying this; it's distinguished economists. I mentioned Danielle Wood, the Productivity Commission chair. Let's remind the House what she had to say about this. She said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Ms Wood was asked whether the Future Made in Australia Bill was some sort of tax reform, she said, 'No, it is not tax reform.' What she said was that alternative policies, including lowering the corporate tax rate, 'would make us more internationally competitive', and she is right. They are the sorts of policy ideas that we should be pursuing if we want to have a competitive manufacturing industry in this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Danielle Wood is not alone. It seems like a whole range of former heads of the Productivity Commission, a very respected body in this country, have come forward and said that this bill puts Australia on the wrong track in terms of increasing productivity. Gary Banks, a former chair of the Productivity Commission, described the Future Made in Australia policy as a 'fool's errand' that risks repeating mistakes of the past by propping up 'political favourites'. Instead, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Seeking to obtain benefits to society through subsidies for particular firms or industries, including in the form of tax concessions, has proven a fool's errand, particularly where the competitive fundamentals are lacking.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I love this particular quote from Mr Banks, who described the scheme as equivalent to Hotel California, saying many will enter the program but few will ever leave. If we're going to talk about The Eagles, the government is saying, 'Take it easy.' We shouldn't be taking it easy in relation to this bill; we should be opposing this bill. When the Prime Minister criticised Mr Banks, Richard Holden, another distinguished economist, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PM says all the wrong things … And his main argument for subsidies is that other countries are doing it. Like a primary school kid telling a teacher: 'but he started it!'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got Danielle Wood, Gary Banks, Richard Holden and Steve Hamilton, an independent economist who said, 'There are many problems with industry policy, and that is a big one. It's why I tend to favour more neutral investment incentives like a lower corporate tax rate or accelerated depreciation. I thought we'd learned these lessons, but apparently not. The bad old days are back.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is like Marty McFly—we're back to the future, and it's not a good future. We've tried this in the past—it never works. The government shouldn't be trying it again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So how does the government's approach different from what the coalition would do? The coalition's plan for the economy and the future of manufacturing in Australia won't be based on corporate handouts. You won't see policy from us based on a political favouritism and you won't see coalition policy based on a minister setting himself up with a bucket of taxpayer money to use how he likes. First, we will rein in spending to take the pressure off inflation. We won't spend billions on corporate welfare for pet projects. Second, we'll wind back Labor's intervention and remove regulatory roadblocks, which are suffocating the economy and stopping businesses going ahead. We'll condense approval processes and cut back on Labor's red tape, which is killing jobs in so many areas, particularly in the mining and resources sector, in the same way that it's killing entrepreneurialism. Third, we'll remove the complexity and hostility of Labor's industrial relations agenda. That's what I said last night: if we are serious about productivity, we must be serious about creating a more flexible workplace, because that's how you encourage businesses to take a chance to take on people and give them a job and encourage them to expand. We will revert to the coalition's former, simple definition of a casual worker and create certainty for 2.5 million small businesses. We know it's not in Labor's DNA to support small business or any other business that isn't under control of their union mates. Fourth, we'll provide lower, simpler, fairer taxes for all, because Australians should keep more of what they earn. Fifth, we will deliver a competition policy which gives consumers and small businesses a fair go—not lobbyists and big corporations. Sixth, we'll ensure Australians have more affordable and reliable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our economic plan—unlike Labor's economic plan, which is based on failed policies of the past—is based on tried, tested principles which will restore competitiveness and economic confidence. The policies we seek to implement aren't just about the next electoral cycle; they are about the foundations for the next generation for Australia. That's why today I am pleased to rise to oppose this high-spending bill, and to oppose corporate welfare for certain manufacturing interests. That is not in Australia's best interests.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  The world is currently undergoing a period, at least in the Western industrialised world, of rapid reindustrialisation. After 40 years of globalisation underwritten by US security and the institutions that rose up out of the rubble of World War II, countries are now reindustrialising. They're looking to recover lost manufacturing and lost jobs. Gone are the days of labour and wage arbitrage, where a lot of manufacturing was offshored to cheaper countries and jurisdictions for the production of goods that we need. We've seen real wages decline over the last 30 or 40 years for workers in the industrial sector, and strategic circumstances are forcing many countries to look at their own industrial base and ask the question: are we sovereign, are we resilient and are we self-reliant?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the war that started in Ukraine in early 2022—Russia's illegal, unjustified and immoral invasion of Ukraine—has brought this into stark relief, and what we've seen over the last two years is that war transforming into a war of attrition—industrial attrition, where we've seen the United States, which supports Ukraine, and its allies, like the UK and European allies like Germany and France in particular, pitted against the industrial base of Russia, which is also supported by China, North Korea and Iran. So we're seeing, in a war where thousands and thousands of people have already died, that it's now grinding into a war of industrial attrition. It's a reminder to people around the world that, if you want to have sovereignty, be secure as a nation and have resilience, you've got to have industrial capacity. It's a key component of national power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So that's why we're seeing investment in industrial bases across the world. The US is leading this, and I refer to a report that came out last month called <span style="font-style:italic;">Commis</span><span style="font-style:italic;">sion on the National Defense Strategy</span>. It's a document that is well worth reading for all parliamentarians. In it, the authors, who are quite eminent national security people in the United States, make some fairly stark judgements about the state of the US and its industrial production. The report says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">U.S. industrial production is grossly inadequate to provide the equipment, technology, and munitions needed today, let alone given the demands of great power conflict.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are reasons for that in the US: there have been insufficient defence budgets, there's been a decline of research and development, there's been insufficient access to strategic and critical minerals and there's been an erosion of the broader US manufacturing ecosystem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can trace that back to 1989, with the fall of the Berlin Wall. The US stood supreme as the global power with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and a lot of the investment that occurred during the Cold War ceased, and we've seen the US military decrease, as well as the industrial base that supported it. Now we're seeing a challenge to the US led rules based global order, if that is what you want to call it. That's what a lot of policy people refer to it as. Because that is being challenged, countries are now having to look to their own security needs, which includes a strong industrial base.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge now, for allies of the US who buy a lot of defence capabilities from the US, is that there is a long queue. The US can't even meet its own needs with its shrunken industrial base, so we need to start thinking about how we recover our industrial capacity as well. That's why AUKUS is such a huge opportunity for Australia. I think if we're going to use any mechanism to recover Australian industrial strength, AUKUS is the best mechanism to do so. I was proud of the coalition government that, back in 2021, struck the original arrangement with President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Boris Johnson. We have since seen two changes of government, one here and one in the UK, and still AUKUS continues strongly. But there is a lot of work to be done, and the decline of the US industrial base is a real challenge for AUKUS. We need the US to uplift, we need the UK to uplift and we, ourselves, need to uplift.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House, the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024, really engages on this question: how do we recover a lot of our lost industrial capacity in this country? Our view, my view, is that this bill does not achieve what the Albanese government is setting out to achieve with this bill. To give some background on the bills, these bills expand the role of Export Finance Australia and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and establish a National Interest Framework that retrospectively underpins the government's Future Made in Australia policy. The accompanying bill expands Export Finance Australia's remit to fund domestic industries and nominates the Minister for Finance as an additional responsible minister. The omnibus bill also expands ARENA's functions from purely research, development and demonstration to support manufacturing, deployment and commercialisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The more we hear about this plan, the more we realise that Labor is misguided in this, and it just doesn't stack up. This is a plan for more government, not business investment partnering with government, and that makes it a weak plan. In fact, we believe that this is a plan for more inflation at a time when Labor has already made homegrown inflation a lot worse. We know they've added $315 billion of spending to the budget over the last two years, and we're still leading the world in inflation. Inflation hasn't come back under control to the two to three per cent target range, which is where we want to get it to, and, again, the Australian people are suffering high interest rates with no relief in sight. I know markets are pricing in a cut somewhere around February or so, but there is no guarantee, because we're seeing what the Queensland government is doing to save its skin prior to the election in October. They're spending a lot of money. The Victorian government and the WA government are spending a lot of money. There is no guarantee that inflation is going to abate anytime soon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has always supported industry and manufacturing. I think back to Robert Menzies and the economy he inherited when he won government back in 1949. A great economy had been built up during World War II, and it was the basis of our prosperity for the next couple of decades until we opened ourselves up to the world under Prime Minister Bob Hawke. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But now Labor's policy on energy, industrial relations and tax is a whole suite of policies and a whole range of things that have occurred under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese over the last two years. It has actually made Australia less competitive and less attractive for international investment. They've also introduced an industrial relations reform package which has made it a lot more difficult for businesses to employ people, to make a profit and to add to Australia's prosperity. That's why we are actually going backwards as a country in terms of productivity, in terms of GDP growth, and people are feeling it. Real wages are going backwards with inflation and, of course, we're seeing households less well off now than they were two years ago under the Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts are clear: insolvencies are up, productivity is down and businesses are struggling just to keep the doors open. And so Labor's plan for a future made in Australia—it's a great little line, and I always remember the Made in Australia tags with that kangaroo on Australian goods growing up. We still see them. I get quite nostalgic about it. I'm proud of an Australia that can make things and sell them to the world. They're tapping into nostalgia with a title, but, when you actually examine the bills, the policy and the detail, it falls far short of the nostalgia that it seeks to evoke.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some challenges here. The ARENA changes are a slush fund for the Minister for Climate Change and Energy. This legislation changes the purpose, duties and roles of ARENA, which has always been a research and development agency. They're now expanding the remit of ARENA into deployment and manufacturing. These changes give the minister for climate change the ability to boost the funding of ARENA without parliamentary oversight and scrutiny, which has been a have it of the Labor government over the last two years. They like to get things through, they like to guillotine debate and they like to empower the ministers to make decisions that avoid parliamentary oversight or scrutiny. You just look at the sitting calendar this year; it's been reduced significantly. All that does is allow for less accountability, and that's not in the best interests of the Australian people or our country over the long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian families are paying the price. We have already seen the 12 interest rate hikes, and we've got some of the most stubborn core inflation in the developed world and the high taxes that come with it. Bracket creep is hurting a lot of families out there, particularly in my seat of Canning, and this has all happened under the Albanese government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also a new national interest framework, and this legislation puts the Treasurer and his department in a position to decide whether a sector of the Australian economy deserves investment. This is less a market-leading solution. Instead, it's a command-economy-style solution. When you run a command-style economy, you assume that those running it have all the knowledge required to make good investment decisions. As we know—you just look at the last 100 years—command economies aren't great at making investment decisions. There are a lot of inefficiencies. There's a lot of waste, preferment, nepotism and all those sorts of problems that come with people making decisions without all the information and without the accountability that a market led solution brings. So that is deeply problematic, and I expect bad decisions, not good decisions, with this framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this place we try to create incentives that will build the security and prosperity of our country—incentives that provide for human flourishing. The incentives that this bill brings in, I think, fall far short of those aspirations. But don't take my word for it. The Business Council of Australia have warned that these procurement rules risk subsidising businesses Australia would never have a comparative advantage in. We are a nation that is blessed with an abundance of resources. That's why we lead the world in exports in coal and liquefied natural gas. I represent a seat which used to be Kim Beazley's seat 25 to 30 years ago, which tells you everything you need to know about the realignment happening in Australia and elsewhere. We produce 10 to 11 per cent of the world's bauxite. We have two bauxite mines and two alumina refineries. I represent a lot of FIFO workers, who leave their families and go to our mine sites, and they're the backbone of this country's prosperity. I am very proud to represent them. I am proud that we have a good number of them who are keen to see us become more productive. I acknowledge that many are unionised members with the AWU. One of the things I've really worked on is having a good relationship with those people, because they are the backbone of this country and they do the heavy lifting that provides for a lot of revenue that is used to fund essential services in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really excited, though, about the investment that the former coalition government took in AUKUS. I acknowledge the work that this government has done in building on that work, with the announcement of the optimal pathway for the Virginia class submarine and the SSN-AUKUS. When we're talking about re-industrialising Australia, I want to focus very briefly on Western Australia. We know that $8 billion of investment is going to flow through Perth especially, just to the north of Canning in Rockingham. There's $8 billion to expand HMAS Stirling over the next decade. There will be 3,000 direct jobs created. There will be an additional $83 million for infrastructure works which will create more than 150 jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">
                    </span>This is not just a one-off. We're going to see a huge naval base at Stirling which will run our nuclear submarines. We'll also have US and UK submarines. We'll have the supply chains and the maintenance facilities to keep those running. We're going to see a big footprint. I think one of the toughest things any country can do is own, operate and build their own submarines. We are undertaking the biggest nation-building project I think we've ever done. This is going to be very complex. It's good that we're doing it with the US and the UK, who already have capability and are experienced. I'm actually excited for industry. But this government is not selling that. Instead they're following the climate change minister on his frolics, talking about green energy and all these great solar panels and the wind farms that will be made in China, when we could be talking about AUKUS and the economic dividend, the job creation and the industrial rebuild that will bring to this country. This government's failing and it needs to do better. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <a href="201906" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I rise to speak on the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024. This is a bad bill. Like so many bills of this government, it is a smoke and mirrors bill that pulls at the heartstrings of Australians. What Australian wouldn't want Australia to manufacture more products onshore? No-one, I'd expect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can remember the retail sector I spent over half my working life in, which was the electrical appliance industry. When I started in this industry, working as a storeman at Errol Stewarts, pretty well everything was made in our great country—Westinghouse fridges were made in a factory in Orange in New South Wales, Simpson and Mallees washing machines in Adelaide, Victor mowers in Ballarat, and Kelvinator fridges, Sunbeam frypans, Chef ovens and Dishlex dishwashers were all made in Australia. You were hard pressed to find an imported product. These factories employed Australian workers, and in many cases were one of, if not the biggest, employers in these towns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I watched with dismay as these products slowly diminished because the price difference between the products made here and the imported products began to widen. My experience has been that people will pay between 10 and 20 per cent for locally made products, but once you get past this point the patriotism wanes as the family budget takes precedence. Fair enough, especially when times are tough, just like now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impacts of this, of course, are that factories close, jobs are lost and people's lives are decimated. But the hard facts are that the market determines this and tough business decisions need to be made. After all, these are businesses, and not charities. I know for a fact that many of them actually ran at a loss in their final few years, resisting the stark reality of their plight as they realised the human element and the devastating effect that laying off hundreds of workers from these factories would have. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How did this happen? Why were we no longer competitive? We always made magnificent products as far as quality and reliability goes. There were many factors, but the four greatest contributors were—rightly or wrongly—firstly, the red tape and compliance which simply adds to the cost of goods that are being produced. This accelerated as more and more of these often unnecessary and in many cases duplicated by two or even three levels of government. Much of this was caused when various Labor governments, in particular, were in power as they increased the public service—not out of need, but purely to buy votes. I have nothing against public servants. They are completely necessary. In fact, my mum was a state public servant her whole life and I have many friends who are public servants. But when you employ more than are necessary they will instill more and more red tape as they have to justify their employment. The problem with this is that it adds to the cost of goods which means that people, in turn, need to earn more to pay for these more expensive goods, which then drives up the wages of people in the factories making the goods, and then the cycle continues and continues until it reaches a point where it was actually cheaper to bring in the goods from overseas. That's when factories close. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other factors, whether we like it or not, are that we're in a global market and every country is fighting for the business to supply other countries with their goods and services. Having run a business myself, I can tell you that the greatest costs to most businesses are the cost of the building you conduct your business out of, whether you purchase or lease the property, the wages you pay and, in manufacturing, energy costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at how we go in these areas. We have the highest minimum wage in the world. We have one of the highest property costs. We have one of, if not the highest, energy costs, and we have red tape. When investors are looking to set up large-scale manufacturing where price is a large factor in people's decision-making on what to purchase, we simply don't stack up. It's a tragedy. It's not that people don't want to manufacture here on a large scale, it's just that we are simply uncompetitive, so they go to another country where all these costs are lower. It's not personal. It's just a business decision. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that you can't wind back the clock. You can't cut wages because people wouldn't be able to survive. As a government, you can't control property prices, but all governments can do something about red tape. Sadly, that on its own will only help a little bit and it won't be enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Energy is somewhere where you can help with the right policy. Energy expectations have changed dramatically in the last decade. Globally, most countries have made the decision to go to cleaner energy. Like most new technologies, these new technologies are initially more expensive than previous and current technology such as coal. In theory this should change over time, but sectors such as manufacturing demand that energy be not only clean but also reliable and affordable. This is where the Labor-Greens coalition and the Liberal-National coalition are miles apart. The Labor-Greens coalition believes that a renewables-only policy will meet these needs, but the evidence and advice from experts and observations from other countries' experiences clearly show that renewables will not supply the reliability or the affordability required by industry, particularly manufacturing, where the energy needs are enormous. I've not even touched on the energy that will be required in the future for data centres as generative AI becomes more and more commonplace. The largest data centre in the world, in Ohio, for example, uses around $850,000 in energy per day as well as an enormous amount of water. This will only continue to grow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why 19 of the 20 countries in the OECD have nuclear energy in their mix. Over the average 80-year lifespan of the reactor, it is less expensive than renewables such as wind and solar, where the infrastructure of panels and wind towers needs to be replaced on average every 20 years. That's four times during the life of a nuclear power plant. Factoring in what the replacement costs of these panels and towers will be in 2040 and 2060 makes it a much more expensive form of energy. The difference in the waste disposal of renewables compared to nuclear is incalculable. Comparing the amount of landfill that would be needed for solar panels and wind towers with the amount needed for nuclear waste over that 80-year period would be like comparing the size of Tasmania with the entire surface area of the sun. The difference in land that will need to be cleared to put in a solar or wind farm compared to a nuclear power station is also stark. A nuclear power plant will need about four hectares and, under the coalition's plan, will generally go where existing coal-fired power stations are, so it will need little to no land clearing. In comparison a solar farm that can generate the same amount of power as one these power stations will need around 4,000 hectares of land cleared. That's not to mention the long-term damage it will cause to the land it sits on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's renewables-only policy will require batteries to store energy when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing. Data shows us that the very unstable element, lithium, that exists in batteries has a very high propensity to catch fire. Ask any firey how hard they are to put out. I know it. In a previous business that I had, we used to sell little golf buggies with lithium batteries. At one o'clock one afternoon there was the smell of smoke, and a buggy that had never even been taken out of the box was suddenly on fire, sitting on six other boxes containing the same lithium batteries. A fire extinguisher was produced, and we tried to put it out to no avail. The fire department was called, and they went, 'Oh my god—a lithium battery!' and dragged it out into the driveway. In about another 10 minutes, they were able to put it out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Brendale, in the Leader of the Opposition's electorate in Moreton Bay shire, where we both are, there is a battery facility that's about to put in 240 batteries. Each one is the size of a 20-foot shipping container. This is not out in the bush; this is in residential north-side Brisbane. The shipping companies have been told, as part of the tender to take in these goods, that they have to make sure that they are stored either with air conditioning or water cooling. This is before they're even plugged in and used. That is how volatile this equipment is. So when people talk about the safety issues of nuclear, I would say that, compared to the safety issues of lithium batteries, they would be insignificant. So, again, nuclear has it over in that element as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All this bill does is subsidise large and, in the main, renewables companies which are driving this. They can't stand on their own two feet without government subsidy, because they know it won't stack up. It's no different to the energy now, where the state government is using taxpayers' money in Queensland to subsidise energy costs by $1,000 and the federal government is subsidising costs by $300. It's because it doesn't stack up without the subsidy. The fact is that raw energy costs have gone up under this government. You can't use taxpayers' money to subsidise taxpayers' bills. It doesn't make any sense. They break your leg and then pay for the plaster and the doctor and expect thanks for it. It doesn't work. We need to incentivise smaller businesses. We can compete in smaller manufacturing, even though those fast-moving goods manufacturers, where there's lots of stuff on a scale, can't compete with these other countries that have low energy costs, lower wages, and all of those things I outlined. At the end of the day, the smaller innovative companies are great companies, such as NLT Technologies in Caboolture, in my electorate of Longman, that employ around 20 to 30 people. They've managed to come up with a wi-fi system that works underground in coalmines. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a small manufacturer down in Narangba that makes mower parts and mower blades. They bought an old stamping machine from the Mitsubishi car factory, which, unfortunately, because of the reasons I outlined, became uncompetitive, so they stopped making cars in this country. They were able to buy that stamping machine, and, to their credit, they're making it. These people are in a market where they don't have to compete against these big guys in China. That's what we should be looking at. We want manufacturing in this country, and we should focus on these smaller manufacturers. One of the companies that makes the mower blades would actually like to make a mower here. That would be awesome. I can remember selling Victor mowers. They were proudly made here. He said the problem is, 'I've done the maths, and if I'm going to manufacture the mower here to compete with the Chinese import that Bunnings sells for $300, it would have to be retail at $600.' People won't pay double the price because it's got an 'Australian made' tag on it. We could help these people out. We need some sensible industrial relations reforms that take into consideration the conditions and the pay of workers and the realistic needs of employers. We need to make sure that we cut back on this red tape, particularly red tape where it is duplicated. We need to make sure that these manufacturers have certainty, reliability, and affordability in terms of their energy needs. That is absolutely what's needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also a matter of trust. Australians I speak to, particularly business owners, simply don't trust this government. They don't trust them. They believe that the priorities have been wrong. They spent their first 18 months in government completely ignoring the Australian people, the cost of living and interest rates rising. They focused completely on something that was driven by the Prime Minister's personal agenda in the Voice to Parliament. They saw $500 million completely wasted on something that would never get up, and they're frustrated. Like so many bills introduced here, the headline is appealing. It's exciting. It gets people's blood flowing. During COVID, we saw an enormous amount of patriotism come back, and, because of necessity, we had to see some local manufacturing happen. We couldn't get things in from overseas because of COVID. People got excited about Australian made again, and I loved it. But once all that wore off, the stark reality of high energy costs, high wage costs, and the industrial relations laws hamstringing businesses and red tape--all that stuff has come back to roost, making it simply impossible for these companies to do it on a large scale. So we're back to reality after that short COVID period, and that has all hit home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like these bills, the headline is so good, but when you go into the detail, that's where the disappointment begins. The headline promises so much, only to be let down by the detail. I hope there can be some common sense put into this. I really hope that the Labor government, for Australia's sake, will go back and take on some of the ideas of the coalition. Let's work together to make sure that we can get it there. I'll tell you now that this bill and the way that it's currently set up and operating will not achieve a future made in Australia. For me, that's very, very sad.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Affordable and reliable energy is a component in every single aspect of manufacturing throughout the supply chain in this country, yet we see the costs of energy rising throughout the nation, notwithstanding the fact that there were commitments from every single one of those opposite that electricity prices would drop if they were elected. We all remember and know that the Prime Minister—on 97 occasions, no less—promised to reduce household energy prices by $275 a year—let alone reduce wholesale energy prices for large manufacturers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we seen since the election? We've seen energy prices increasing exponentially. In fact, I was with a truss manufacturer. An area that I would say is a bright spot in this country is manufacturing that supports our residential construction industry. Truss manufacturing in this nation, utilising, in most cases, Australian timber, is a bright spot, but this particular truss manufacturer I spoke to has said that his monthly energy bills in his business have risen from $15,000 a month to $40,000 a month. What happens with that increase of $25,000 a month on that input into every single truss that he manufactures? Well, that just finds its way into the price of that product. That product then finds its way into the home, and guess who bears that cost in the end? It is the buyer or purchaser of that home. In many cases, it is first home buyers who will ultimately bear the cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the additional input costs of that truss that that first home buyer in many cases is bearing; it will be the increased energy costs in the bricks and the increased energy costs in the tiles for the roof—the increased input and energy costs into every single component of that home. So you don't assist manufacturing in this country by increasing energy prices on every single step of manufacturing in this country and then playing a two-card trick and saying, 'We'll support some hand-picked businesses here and there.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were speaking in this chamber about the CFMEU tax on housing—the CFMEU tax aided and abetted by every single member sitting opposite me, who has personally benefited from the CFMEU in one way, shape or form, whether it's through their pre-selection or whether it's through donations to the Labor Party. Where do those donations come from? Ultimately, the CFMEU extorts them out of law-abiding individuals, businesses and, ultimately—in many cases—first home buyers, who have to pay more for that home. That money then goes into the pocket of CFMEU officials or the organisation and then gets donated to members opposite. That's another area where a lack of flexibility in the workplace is increasing costs—</span>

The minute that happens, great offence is taken and we get this clownish behaviour, with someone who has probably never opened that book before in his life. Running a protection racket for the CFMEU is ingrained in what they do because every single one of them benefits from the CFMEU. To the decent people in the Labor Party—of which I know there are many—I'd say: the money that you take from the CFMEU is money that's taken out of the pockets of first home buyers in this country. That is the eternal shame of the Labor Party. It's a disgrace that you would aid and abet the CFMEU for so many years. You've been called out now and—Deirdre Chambers—you're all very surprised about the CFMEU, like it's some huge, massive shock to each and every one of you when you watched the Channel 9 reporting on the CFMEU.</span>

                    </a>  Flexible workplaces are very important for manufacturing in this country. We know, and I think it's been completely admitted by those opposite, that the conduct of the CFMEU, that rogue criminal organisation that has supported them financially for many, many years, has made it much harder for manufacturing in this country. As shadow housing minister and as a former housing minister, I can see what it's done to manufacturing in this country. We have a proud manufacturing industry that supports residential construction in this country. The truth is that the Labor Party has turned a blind eye to the CFMEU for years. One can only infer that's because of the material financial support that they have provided to the Labor Party for many, many years. It's also instructive that the Labor Party only takes huge offence when the connection between them and the CFMEU is drawn to the attention of the House. Maybe it's because of the close personal relationships that many of them have with the senior leadership of the CFMEU, the close personal relationships between John Setka and themselves. That adds to the cost base of businesses in this country and makes it a lot harder to manufacture in Australia. We've got inflexibility being driven by the government here. We've got a lack of ability to deliver affordable and reliable energy. We all know about businesses, whether they be in Victoria or South Australia, who are ordered at peak times of energy need to turn off their plants because we don't have an energy system that can support that sort of manufacturing 24/7. There are times of the year when I know businesses will contact me in Victoria and say, 'We've been ordered to cease manufacturing for'—it might be four hours during a particular period on a particular day. That is a direct consequence of Labor Party policy in that state over many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to have a viable and strong manufacturing industry in this country, I go back to the earlier points. You need to have affordable and reliable energy. You need to have flexible workplaces. You need less regulation on businesses. I'm sure even the geniuses on the other side would understand that you need less regulation in order to manufacture. You need an even playing field. There are products that are imported into this country that do not meet the standards that we require of our manufacturers, and that is exacerbated by this government. We will not be supporting this bill. We won't be supporting the pork-barrelling of the government. Certainly, a government that is in bed with the CFMEU has no credibility. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  I think the previous speaker was quite right in praising Paul Keating—the architect of free markets and free trade in Australia. To quote him: 'We will now remove all support levels.' Well, Mr Keating, no-one explained to you about sending your gladiator into the ring with no helmet and no shield when the other gladiator has a helmet and a shield. You know the story: 'Hey, I need a shield and a helmet'; 'No, if you fight without a shield and a helmet it will make you tough'; 'No, it won't; it'll make me dead, that's what it'll make me.' So why did Mr Keating taking away our shield, our protection and our support levels have this gentleman on the Liberal Party advocating and praising Paul Keating for a free market? Well—no motorcars are made in Australia, no electricity is going to come from Australia and no clothing comes from Australia except for, God bless, Andrew Twiggy Forrest and the Steel Blues of this world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost all of our seafood and pork comes from overseas. Almost all of our household appliances come from overseas. We had the absolutely incredible decision to buy our army boots from overseas. I happen to represent part of the garrison city of Townsville, and in the annual Anzac Day march 2,000 soldiers had the soles of their boots fall out. There were big pictures of all of the soles. That same day, I raced back to Charters Towers for a catafalque party and I said, 'Is this right that all the soles are falling off the shoes? The sergeant major in charge of the catafalque party lifted up his foot and he had no sole on his shoe. He was doing it in his socks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You've taken the free markets to the most extraordinary heights. In the field of agriculture our farmers—last time I looked—are on a five per cent support level from the government. The OECD figure is around 40 per cent support levels for all the farmers on earth. Ours are five per cent. They are asking us to race a 100-metre race but are giving our opponents a 35-metre start. Mate, I could beat Linford Christie if they gave me that sort of start, I assure you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is making an endeavour to come back here. They want us to produce all this zero emissions stuff. I happen to be, unlike everyone else in this place, a little bit of an expert in this field because I put in the first standalone solar system in Australia in 1982-1983. Most of you weren't even born in 1982. Most of you weren't even born. I had to have a very detailed knowledge. Also, we have the best silicon deposits in the world, and I, unlike the people in this place, want all of our solar panels to be built from silicon that we got and upgraded here in Australia. I will rephrase that—I didn't want the cells made because they're a very small market, but I did want the high-tech silicon for your computers and silicon chips for your terrestrial wire that carries electricity and information. We wanted it for that and other uses. We wanted high-tech silicon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You've got to listen to me on this, right? To create high-tech silicon, you must first crush it up. This is very difficult. To process it, you've got to crush it. It is the second hardest metal to diamond, so crushing it is not a lot of fun and it costs you a lot of money. Then you put it under electromagnets to pick up the iron. It burns up enormous amounts of electricity. Most of all, we chose to process by the carbon arc technology. You have two carbon rods with huge electricity going through. You pull them apart, you've got this powerful flame and you hourglass the silicon flower—as it is now—past it, and that's smelts it. The other way of doing it is with coal. The electricity comes from coal anyway. You will never be able to pay for silica if you're going to get it out of solar panels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know about other people, but I used to fly over from Cairns across to Georgetown and there were beautiful trees and a nature wonderland everywhere. I fly now and I'm looking at glass everywhere. To quote the professor leading the action against Chalumbin, 'What's happening here?' I'll tell you what's happening here: our beautiful nature wonderland is being transformed into an industrial wasteland. Is there any person in this place that's going to tell me that we are going to reprocess 10,000 square kilometres of glass in 20 years time? That is not going to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the technology—the honourable Minister Plibersek is well on top of the technology, by the way—for algae. You want as much carbon dioxide as you can possibly produce for your algae farms. So carbon dioxide is valuable. Coca-Cola is made with carbon dioxide. Trees grow on carbon dioxide. It's very valuable. We can make a lot of money and overcome our problems with CO2 from coal mines. And if there's a person who seems to be an expert in this field it's Tanya Plibersek, the relevant minister. Whether they give her the money to do it or not is another story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the way it works at the present moment. We've got NAIF out there. We've got all sorts of special assistance from government and we're adding another one here. But I'll tell you how this works. Tom Long has to package it. Now, seven per cent of Australia's fruit and vegetables comes out of Far North Queensland, where Tom Long lives and where my electorate is. We have to box it and send it to the Woolworth and Coles in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane—everywhere. It has to be boxed. It's boxed in polystyrene. It takes a lot of carbon dioxide to produce polystyrene, and you can use it only once. Tom Long's product is used 28 times and then can be recycled again so it goes back into the marketplace. He applied for money and I'll tell you why he didn't get it: because he had a big house and a couple of acres of land, and he had the factory with his house. They just said, 'No, he's not a real producer of anything.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A bloke called Henry Ford started building motorcars in the garage in his backyard. But these morons that live here—fifth-generation public servants, inbred as all hell—make these decisions: 'Oh, Tommy Long couldn't possibly produce anything of value, because he's doing it in his backyard like Henry Ford did.' To this very day, Ford's Model T is the car most sold anywhere in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You may not have noticed, but the number of us over here on the crossbench is growing really big. The ALP and LNP governments—they're one and the same—that govern Australia bought their army boots from China. Our electricity comes from China. You have to turn on a light at the discretion of the Chinese people who make the solar panels. Because you want to have all EVs, the fuel in your motorcar will be coming from solar panels from China. So the fuel in your motorcar is going to come from China. But they're very reliable people—a very decent government over there! They're people to look up to, aren't they? We can trust them, of course!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The serious economies on earth, the BRIC economies—Brazil, Russia, India, China and I would add the United States—are spitting on this idea of going all solar and all that rubbish. That's the old world. That's Europe. The new world has absolutely no interest in it. Have a look at who's up on the Galilee Basin, where half of our coal is. Who's up there? I'll tell you: the Indians and the Chinese. You have some sort of idea that those poor people in India, 600 million of them without electricity, are going to let you stop them from having power stations. Who the hell do you think you are? You are a little bunch of 26 million overwhelmingly European people sitting here in Asia, and you're going to tell China and India that they can't have any electricity? You're walking on very dangerous ground; that's all I can say.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of all the things we want to make in Australia—and this sounds a bit off course—No. 1 is Australians. Sadly, in our country, when 20 Australians die, they will only be replaced by 17 Australians. We are a vanishing race. With our tax regime, DINKs, double income no kids, who make $100,000 each will have a disposable income of $75,000 per person after tax. If it's a husband, wife and three kids, and the mum stays home to look after the kids and bring them up properly—a single income and a number of kids, or SINKs—they have an income of $100,000, but it's divided amongst five people, so they get $15,000 after tax. How is it fair that the DINKs have an income of $75,000 and the SINKs have $15,000? There are not a lot of people in Australia having kids—surprise, surprise! When I was a young man—and a little bit of skiting—we had five kids. I paid virtually no tax because the concessions for having children were real. They cost you this amount of money, so you were taxed on your real incomes per person instead of this vicious discriminatory tax system which is watching us vanish as a race of people. So, most of all, we want to make kids.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is something else I want to mention. The army boots didn't work. I have a brass-handled knife made in China for $9. The brass in that knife cost more than $9. The steel in that knife cost more than $9. And yet the whole knife was $9.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike other countries, we provide no money or capital for investment development. We have QPM making all of the products that need to go into new generation batteries throughout the world for EVs and hybrids. Why wouldn't a government move to a hybrid flexi-fuel motor car running on ethanol? Brazil is 49.2 per cent ethanol, and it's $1.09 a litre. Last time I looked, we were $2.01 a litre here in Australia. Why wouldn't you do that? Because you're under the influence of and actually controlled, directly or indirectly, by the big corporations. The only people in this place who are not are sitting in this crossbench. We may not get it right on many things, but we're not controlled by the big corporations like you people, who are just a bunch of puppets controlled by the big corporations. That's all you are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How can you explain condemning your country to all of its electricity coming from China? How can you condemn your country to getting all of its electricity from China and, since you want to move to EVs, all of your fuel for your motor cars from China and all of your motor cars from China. Let me just home in on fuel. In 1990, all of your fuel came from Australia; 98 per cent came from Australia. Now, we import $50 billion a year of fuel from overseas. Our entire exports are only $500 billion, and one-tenth of those are being eaten up by us buying the fuel from overseas. Introduce a flexi motor car for all government cars, and you can forget about sending the $50 billion overseas. Ethanol and electricity are produced in Australia, but a hybrid doesn't use a lot of electricity—hardly any at all, actually.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the answers are there, and you must ask yourself: 'Why won't they go to the answers? Why?' There's just no rational explanation as to why you wouldn't do that. If you say, 'Australia couldn't produce a motorcar,' that's exactly what was said to Laurence Hartnett again and again and again and to the Prime Minister of Australia, Ben Chifley again and again and again.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  I rise to make a contribution on this bill on behalf of the communities of Calare and Central Western New South Wales. I have listened to the debate on both sides of the aisle. The opposition's approach has been a wholesale rejection of the bill, dismissing it out of hand. While I agree that there are definitely flaws in this bill, I think a more constructive approach is warranted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is well-intentioned and deserves proper consideration on its merits, not just pointscoring. For example, one of the arguments used against the bill by the member for Hume was that this bill would be inflationary. I had to smile when I heard those words. Let's get one thing straight. The fuse on the inflation bomb, which has now exploded and which is causing pain and grief across Australia, and in particular regional communities, was well and truly lit during the course of the previous government. People may not recall, but for the first time the Reserve Bank of Australia resorted to do what is called quantitative easing—which is a fancy way of saying the Reserve Bank resorted to printing money in order to pay for the extraordinary spending spree. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't just the government of the day that's to blame. The opposition was well and truly along for the hayride, and they probably would have spent more if they'd been in power then. Indeed, the only thing the government did not do during COVID was drop money on communities out of helicopters, and believe it or not there is actually a thing called helicopter money. So if you want to talk about who was to blame for the inflation bomb, there's plenty of blame to go around on both sides of the House, and we need to be upfront, open and honest about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Leaving aside the political argy-bargy between the major parties, it has to be acknowledged that there are positive aspects to this bill. Five priority industries or sectors have been developed, including critical minerals processing and renewable hydrogen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is my concern. I am looking at this bill through the looking glass of regional Australia and attempting to determine what benefit there could be. Critical minerals processing is obviously an important one. There may be benefit in Central Western New South Wales in this, boosting critical minerals—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr GEE:</span>
                    </a>  I take the interjection from the member for Kennedy. He's a very tough act to follow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Boosting critical minerals processing and production is an issue of national importance and security. Given the deposits of critical minerals in Central Western New South Wales, it is possible that this bill could bring benefits to our area that will result in employment and business opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Against this is that the areas of priority are far too restrictive. This bill could be of much greater benefit to our nation, and in particular country Australia, if the areas of priority were expanded to include food processing and agriculture. We saw during COVID how vulnerable nations were when their supply chains were cut or threatened. Food security must be a key priority of our nation. Food-processing is one area in which Australia does have a strong advantage. Our processing plants are in close proximity to our primary producers and it's one area of our economy which requires strong support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the food processing operations in the Calare electorate, they include such powerhouses as Ferrero, which makes Australia's Nutella and Tic Tacs in Lithgow, and Simplot which produces the iconic Chiko role, and, as we know, Bathurst is the undeniable and undisputed home of the Chiko role. We have two pet food processing plants, with the Mars Petcare plant at Bathurst and the Nestle Purina factory at Blayney, while Devro in Bathurst makes sausage casings. We also have very vibrant food processing businesses in our smaller communities, such as Manildra Mills which is a flour mill in Manildra and the MSM milling plant which processes canola oil in Manildra. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is of great concern to me that this sector has inexplicably been overlooked in this legislation. Those industries need all the support they can get. They are a huge employer in our area. It really surprises me that food processing has not been identified as a area of national priority and support. This package will deliver tens of billions of dollars, but how much of that will actually flow to the regions? At the moment, it doesn't look like any is flowing to food security and the future generations of Australians that are employed in agriculture and food processing. It is a glaring oversight in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another glaring oversight is the lack of support for agriculture in this bill. Australia has the best produce in the world. The food basket of our country is located in regional Australia and in particular central western New South Wales, and it defies belief that the agriculture sector has not been identified as an area of priority for this bill. The gross value of agricultural production has increased by 51 per cent in the last 20 years to $94.3 billion in 2022-23. If you look back to the global financial crisis and then the crisis brought on by the pandemic, one of the key sectors which carried Australia through was agriculture. Agriculture has been a vital plank in Australia's economic prosperity that has sustained our nation through the generations. We need to support it. If you want to support food security and production, protect against supply chain disruptions and boost regional employment, you have to support agriculture. So let's funnel some of this money to agriculture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can also support agriculture by cutting red tape for ag businesses. We can support their export markets and not destroy them. I am talking about keeping the sheep. We can funnel some of this funding to support ag start-ups. Let's support jobs in agriculture. If you want to talk about the environment, there are some very promising developments in agriculture that benefit both farmers and the environment, including the conversion of atmospheric CO2 to soil carbon, which increases yields and also allows farmers to turn a badly needed dollar or two. It really is highly surprising that agriculture has not been a part of the conversation surrounding this bill. Our farmers and food processors deserve much better, as do the supply chains that support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I therefore flag that I will be moving amendments to include food processing and agriculture as areas of priority in this bill and the billions of dollars of funding that this bill will deliver. I do so wanting to draw the government's attention to the fact that these key sectors have been overlooked, and they must be supported. If we want this bill to be effective, we need to support agriculture and food processing and to bolster Australia's food security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As my amendments make clear, I have concerns as to whether this bill will deliver tangible benefits to our regional communities. I share the concerns of the member for Indi, who referred to a giant question mark over the integrity and transparency aspects of this bill. It is right to ask whether the public has a clear line of sight on where the $22.7 billion of our country's wealth will be spent. I'm just not convinced that this bill as it stands at the moment will deliver and see enough benefits flowing to central western New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would urge all members in this House at this time, including the member for Kennedy and the member for Wide Bay—I know the member for Wide Bay has crossed the aisle and, indeed, sat on the crossbench before—to support this bill. I would urge the government to back my amendments supporting food processing and agriculture and all of the hardworking women and men in regional Australia who are employed in those sectors.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:33</span>):  I rise to oppose the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024. We have just heard from the member for Calare, who spent 10 minutes outlining why the bill is quite a bad bill and why this kind of government spending doesn't meet the scrutiny test for effective spending by government, and yet, like all agrarian socialists, his complaint about this bill is simply that he hasn't allocated the government spending, that he hasn't decided which sector it will go to. But if it goes to his preferred sector, by amendment, then somehow the spending will become good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I approach this bill from a different perspective, and that is that, in the inflationary crisis that we are in, this additional government spending is going to cause more trouble for the economy in terms of inflation—the hidden tax that we all wear—but also the tax that comes from more government spending through our debt and the other financing that the government uses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the title sounds good, we've gone back to the Rudd era of Orwellian title names: a future made in Australia? Nobody could oppose a future made in Australia. But, of course, this money will not lead to a future made in Australia; it's simply more misallocated government spending. This time, uniquely through this bill, it is at the discretion of the executive, as if a government minister has the capacity to allocate capital in a way that will be most efficient inside our economy and produce the best results for a future made in Australia. The bureaucrats who advise him and are inexpert at understanding the demand and supply of the economy and aren't integrally involved in that process day to day will somehow provide some magical form of advice to the executive where a government minister will allocate borrowed money in a way that will produce efficient results.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we all know where this is going. This money will be spent, but it will not be spent efficiently. It will not be spent in a way that produces a future made in Australia. It will simply be spent at the cost of more inflation, higher more taxes and higher government debt. That's why I oppose this bill fundamentally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Milton Friedman spoke about this when he spoke about this misallocation of government capital and the increase in government spending. At a time when the Reserve Bank is warning about the government about its spending profile, simply putting a bill in to spend more money at the discretion of the minister is not going to do it in terms of reducing the critical challenge of our time: inflation and the hidden tax that Australia represents on every good and service in our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look through what's already occurring, we see that the Productivity Commission has told us through this bill that the $1 billion commitment to solar panels in Australia under the Future Made in Australia program should be retrospectively subjected to a tougher national interest test framework. I think that's a polite way of saying you can produce solar panels in so many countries in the world now at about five to 10 times cheaper than Australia can possibly make them, so why would we mandate the production of solar panels? Only a government could be so stupid as to say, 'Let's produce solar panels when we can get them 10 times cheaper somewhere else.' Only a government could misallocate that capital so badly that the Productivity Commission politely says, 'We should retrospectively subject this $1 billion solar panel program to a National Interest Framework test.' It's very polite language, but what it says is, 'This is a barking disaster.' What the Productivity Commission is saying is, 'We're wasting a ton of money.' What the Productivity Commission is saying is, 'You are burning government capital and adding to the inflation burden in Australia for no benefit.' However many solar panels we produce, that same billion dollars could buy five to 10 times the amount of solar panels. It's a misallocation of government capital, and it will not produce an efficient solar panel industry in Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What could this money be better used for—even tax credits or tax production credits, which I don't hesitate to say are not a bad idea in many sectors. What could this capital do if it were instead allocated efficiently? These are the questions the Productivity Commission has raised about the manufacture of solar panels. What kind of projects will we see? The government has said a PsiQuantum computer and quantum computing. It might be a virtue. It might be something our economy needs, but why does the government need to allocate $1 billion of public money to a new technology that is potentially going to be one of the most revolutionary and profitable in the world's history if it gets going? There's no answer to these questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission has been absolutely damning about this kind of government spending and the use of government and government bureaucracy to try to allocate this money in an efficient way. And is this the time? We have demands on our school system and our health system? There are plenty of calls on government spending as it is, and the Treasurer is under right now from Labor education ministers and health ministers around the states. Yet here we are allocating $1 billion inefficiently that will not produce a future made in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The critical problems for manufacturing anywhere in the country are the input costs that they face: their energy costs, the cost of production, their labour costs. The government says, 'High wages, high wages.' We do have the highest wages in the world, but we don't compete on those wage costs internationally. We can't compete. It's factored in that we have the highest wages in the world, but it doesn't mean we can compete internationally with our manufacturing sector. So what can we compete on? We now have energy prices moving to the highest in the world. Well, manufacturing can't compete on energy input costs, so what can manufacturing compete on in Australia if none of these things? These are the questions that the government is not answering. Are we going to look at our taxes on employment or our company tax structures? No. There is silence on these critical questions that could actually make a manufacturing company more competitive and able to manufacture at a profit in Australia. That's why we're losing so much manufacturing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the modern challenges of advanced manufacturing are not being addressed. Advanced manufacturers in Australia will tell you that they can innovate and produce advanced manufacturing products within Australia. Even under the weight of wages, energy costs, other input costs, taxes and regulation, they can still come up with a competitive advantage, which is then stolen internationally, replicated and sold back to Australia. This cripples the innovation and the upfront investment from those corporations. If the government were spending this $1 billion in a way that protected our advanced manufacturing sector from this stealing and replicating that has been going on for many years, that would be a better allocation of the capital. But instead we're going to have this 1950s model where a government minister advised by bureaucrats decides where to spend $1 billion, and this is going to produce efficient manufacturing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hate to say that this is not going to work. It's going to be a complete waste of government capital. It's apparent in the very design of this bill. We know that Treasury wasn't consulted prior to the investment in solar manufacturing. Again, I go back to it because $1 billion has been allocated to solar panels, which can be produced five or 10 times cheaper in other countries. Why would we do this? Why would we allocate money to solar? Everybody, including the Productivity Commission and Treasury, is saying this solar program is misallocated capital at the wrong time. We have nothing against solar panels at all, but there is a global production glut of solar panels at the moment. But of course the Australian government says now is the time to spend government capital instead of allowing that capital to be used by the private sector or in the form of other pro-manufacturing-industry policies that might actually make it easier to manufacture in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many good reasons why we oppose this bill. The ARENA changes in particular are quite egregious. Again, the crossbench has been so polite in not calling them out. The ARENA changes really do highlight this, and it's clear in the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech from the minister. They are changing the operation of ARENA. Why is the CEFC even now needed if industries are commercially viable? Once they get to a certain point of government investment, why are these changes needed if they are viable and why do they need government funding? The minister will have the power at the stroke of a pen to boost funding without any scrutiny and without being subjected to any real test. These ARENA changes, when you go through them—and there is obviously some difficulty in understanding how every element will operate—mean no parliamentary oversight and no scrutiny. The crossbench has been talking about transparency, but under delegated legislation the government can roll out up to $3.98 billion by our estimates, with an election approaching. But even if there wasn't an election approaching, government spending of $3.98 billion done in this way isn't a good idea for any government and will be subject to a lot of waste and a lot of deadweight in its service delivery, in its bureaucracy and administration costs, and in its outcome, especially when you look at some of the ways this capital is being allocated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given how many challenges manufacturing in Australia is facing, state and federal governments should be tackling the input cost issue. All input costs are rising. At the same time as we have rising input costs, government is doing nothing for manufacturing in relation to its energy costs, which continue to be one of the biggest factors in manufacturing. It's true that, with the exception of perhaps Queensland, for maybe a decade or more, we've had no new investment in gas, which is one of the prime necessities for manufacturing in Australia. Even in a big state like New South Wales, we've had 15 years of no new gas projects. There are gas bans in big states like Victoria. They're not banning fracking or unconventional gas; they're banning conventional gas in a state like Victoria. Therefore our energy costs have continued to rise, and this bill doesn't do anything to address those issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest booster of green hydrogen is scaling back their ambitions for green hydrogen. Green hydrogen is completely unproven when we have conventional gas available now and lots of gas under us in every part of Australia that we could be using now to provide cheap energy for manufacturing, which would actually sustain an Australian manufacturing sector, but we're not allowed to use the conventional gas. We have to then use government subsidies and money to subsidise green hydrogen, which is still unproven and has not yet been tested. So, again, we are seeing that their own investments don't meet the standards already to actually provide for a future made in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They can say, 'We want a future made in Australia,' all they like. Everybody wants a future made in Australia. We love manufacturing. It'd be great to have more Australian manufacturing. But it isn't just saying it. You've got to understand the practical issues that manufacturing actually faces, and government is there to do that. Spending more simply won't produce that. Spending more in a misallocated way actually risks all those efficient manufacturers that are trying to compete with inflated government spending that is allocated by a government minister with people in Treasury in Canberra telling them that this is the best way to spend the government's money. We've been here before. It doesn't work. It won't work this time. It won't produce an efficient manufacturing sector either, and I think many of those opposite know that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why don't we curtail this bill and come back with some real proposals to actually decrease the input costs for manufacturing in Australia and make it viable and sustainable? That would actually help the manufacturing sector, and that's what they're calling out for. We can do something about their energy costs. We can do something about their regulatory and tax environments, actually sustain the economy and make sure that it would actually go better. That's why I oppose this bill and the coalition is opposing this bill. This clearly does appear to be a ministerial slush fund before an election. It has all the hallmarks of it. It doesn't really matter how it is spent. With a government minister allocating it, the capital is very likely, if not almost 100 per cent certain, to be misallocated in our economy and not spent in a way that will produce a future made in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="37998" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  First of all, I want to thank all of the members who have contributed to this debate over the past fortnight. I think the vast majority of the colleagues on this side of the House have made good, considered, meaningful contributions to this debate, unlike the member just a moment ago, but I appreciate all of the contributions that have been made over the past fortnight or so. I'm grateful for the opportunity to sum up that debate for the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 and the Future Made in Australia (Omnibus Amendments No. 1) Bill 2024 that the Minister for Climate Change and Energy introduced a couple of weeks ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These two bills are a major step in implementing the Albanese Labor government's Future Made in Australia agenda to deliver our country's next generation of prosperity. They're all about helping make Australia a renewable energy superpower and an indispensable part of the global net zero economy. It's all about more closely aligning our national security and our economic security interests. It's all about modernising and strengthening our economy in a world powered increasingly by cleaner and cheaper energy. It's also about grabbing the vast industrial and economic opportunities which flow from the global energy transformation and to share the benefits of those opportunities in communities right across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 embeds into law the strict criteria and robust processes that will guide our decision-making and set us up for success. The legislation is built on three main pillars: firstly, the National Interest Framework, which will help us identify sectors where we have a sustained comparative advantage in the new net zero economy or an economic resilience and security imperative to invest; secondly, a robust sector assessment process to help us better understand and break down barriers to private investment in key areas of our economy; and, thirdly, a set of community benefit principles that will help ensure that public investment and the private investment that it generates and leverages lead to strong returns and stronger communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Made in Australia (Omnibus Amendments No. 1) Bill 2024 steps out how we will put that discipline and rigour into practice by expanding the roles of Export Finance Australia and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency so that they can make investments consistent with our National Interest Framework. Together, the two bills recognise that the world is changing as the planet moves to that future powered by cheaper and cleaner energy. Amidst this change, Australia has been dealt the most incredible set of cards, and we need to play those cards to make ourselves the primary beneficiaries of this new net zero economy. We've got a unique combination—a very advantageous combination—of geological, meteorological, geographical and geopolitical advantages, and we know it would be an egregious breach of our generational responsibilities as a government if we didn't play this winning hand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, we welcome and acknowledge the discussion, the debate and the public scrutiny of these bills that has occurred in the House over the past two weeks. I might also say how grateful I am to crossbench members for the opportunity to meet and discuss elements of these deals with them particularly this week. I think the debate has shown that many members of this House understand that these bills will help Australia grasp the jobs and opportunities of the energy transformation. And I think members understand that they will help give investors the clarity and the certainty they need in order to invest and unlock growth in our economy and understand that these bills will ensure that the benefits of that investment flow to our people and communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the debate many members on this side of the House and on the crossbench acknowledged how important it is, for Australia's prosperity, to get this legislation right. We have listened to the points made about transparency and rigour around investment decisions. That is precisely why we are enshrining the framework and processes underpinning a Future Made in Australia into the law that is before us. It's why the National Interest Framework will be supported by transparent Treasury led analysis to the extent that sectors align with the framework, and these assessments will be tabled in parliament. A number of amendments have been moved in relation to the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024. Again, we thank members for their engagement with the bill, and we will consider the detailed amendments put to us in good faith.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also, unfortunately, heard some pretty bizarre and unhinged contributions from those opposite. One said that prioritising local communities, secure jobs and skills is 'Orwellian'! The same joker said that putting national security and economics together is 'ideological'! The same person described the Australian Renewable Energy Agency as a slush fund, which is surprising, because it was the shadow Treasurer who said that, and he oversaw the Australian Renewable Energy Agency for about four years as the minister responsible for it! He described it as a slush fund. The opposition member who spoke a moment ago talked in similar terms. It hasn't dawned on them—they haven't taken the time to understand—that, of the $22.7 billion allocated in the budget for this Future Made in Australia plan, around $22 billion is a combination of tax breaks determined by production or investments determined by independent arm's-length bodies: ARENA, NZEA and others. Either that is a point that has been lost on those opposite or they are being deliberately dishonest about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition's arguments in the debate reaffirmed what we already knew: this is a contest between the maddies over there and the mainstream over here. We are part of a new global orthodoxy. Our view is mainstream. It's middle of the road. It's all about sharing the views of the investment community here and abroad, who do understand this opportunity that's before us. I met with the Investor Group on Climate Change this week. I met with the AWU and the AMWU this week. There is a broad constituency—a very mainstream, middle-of-the-road constituency—representing workers, representing the investor community, who understand, appreciate and support what we are proposing in these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think sensible people know that it would be self-defeating to let the global net zero opportunity pass us by. That's why it's important that we pass these bills. The time to act on this is now. The world is changing, with or without Australia, and the golden opportunity in front of us will disappear if we take too long. And if we get stuck in the past, our people will be poorer, our economy will be weaker and our country will be more vulnerable. That's why we need to progress this legislation that is before the House and why I'm proud to commend these bills to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  I am pleased to rise in support of the Universities Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Bill 2024, as brought to the House by the magnificent, masterful and always amusing Minister for Education. This bill provides substantial support for past, current and prospective students through a variety of forward-thinking and progressive reforms. The Universities Accord is an initiative of this Labor government. We recognise that, although we have a good education system, there are ways to make it better and ways to make it fairer. That's why Labor directed $2.7 million over two years from 2022-23 to conduct a 12-month review of the Australian higher education system. It was the first board review of higher education since 2008, when I made my first speech in this parliament, and it was conducted by an expert panel. The members of the panel, led by Professor Mary O'Kane AC, were thorough in their approach. Their review covered crucial pictures of the higher education picture, including student fees, teaching, international students and research. The panel considered more than 800 public submissions and held nearly 200 stakeholder consultations.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aim of the review, as Professor O'Kane urged, was to be bold, to think big and to think beyond the immediate challenges. The panel was interested in positioning the higher education sector for long-term security through improvements to quality, accessibility, affordability and sustainability. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Universities Accord</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;">final report</span>—quite a lengthy tome—was released in February this year and includes 47 recommendations. To quote from the summary report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Its message is simple and direct: if Australia is to prosper in the years ahead, Australian participation, performance and investment in tertiary education needs to improve in order to generate the knowledge, skills and research our nation needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To achieve this, the accord recommends changes in these areas amongst others: participation; the relationship between vocational education and training and universities; and student contributions, repayments and support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 and implements the first stage of the planned Universities Accord reforms. The headline reforms were part of the Labor budget in May. Labor is wiping $3 billion of student HELP debt. I'll say that again because those opposite don't seem to be telling their constituents about it: Labor is wiping $3 billion of student HELP debt. We're implementing a Commonwealth Prac Payment for teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students. Teaching was my first career. My mum was a nurse. My next-door neighbour is a midwife. And my wife was a social worker for 25 years before she saw the dark side and became a lawyer. We're also expanding the fee-free university-ready course program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision to reform the indexation methodology for the Higher Education Loan Program reflects Labor's core value of fairness—a value that has been underpinning the Labor Party for 130-plus years. The changes will apply to HELP, which some people still know as HECS; VET student loans; Australian apprenticeship support loans; student start-up loans; ABSTUDY student start-up loans; and the Student Financial Supplement Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill changes the way the debt is indexed. It caps the indexation rate of the lower of either the consumer price index or the wage price index. This reform will be backdated to 1 June 2023, which means that three million Australians will have their debt cut. We're also fixing the impact of last year's CPI indexation rate of 7.1 per cent and replacing it with the lower wage price index rate of 3.2 per cent, something quite significant when you consider the joys of compound interest when it comes to student debt. We will also wipe out the 4.7 per cent increase from this year and reduce it to four per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These numbers speak for themselves. A person with an average HELP debt of $26,500 will have around $1,200 wiped from their debt. Someone with a debt of $45,000—not untoward for lawyers and doctors and the like—will have around $2,000 taken off their debt, and a worker with a debt of $60,000 will have their debt reduced by almost $2,700. Not surprisingly, the constituents who contacted my office after the announcement were very grateful. One constituent described their relief as 'incredibly welcome'. Another said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is going to make such a big impact in my life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And a third student wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Thanks for listening to uni students and alumni across the country! Changing the way student debt is calculated benefits all students for years to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, more than three million Australians will benefit from wiping $3 billion of student debt. This is a direct cost-of-living relief for students, new graduates, workers, apprentices and trainees in every community across this nation. Not only does this reform provide substantial financial relief; it protects our student loan scheme, a system that is necessary to provide access to higher education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next measure that will substantially help students is the Commonwealth prac payment. It's something the education minister should be particularly proud of. Practical experience is a key element of degrees for teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work. You need to go to the coalface and speak to those in your profession when it comes to teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work. I know the former teachers in the caucus, including the whip, understand the important role that a mentor/teacher provides, and I am sure that it's the same for nursing, midwifery and social work. I'm getting affirmation from Ged Kearney about the role of nursing and midwifery. They're important roles. For social work, there are so many different streams to go out and experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned before, my wife was a frontline child protection worker. She was one of those people who knocked on doors in the middle of the night when everything had gone to hell in a handbasket for a family. It would be good for people to experience some of that mental work to understand what they're going into. We don't want people to complete a degree and then step into the workplace and say, 'This is not for me.' Practicums are a part of that saying, 'This is a tough job.' We know that teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work are tough jobs. No-one turns up at an ED to say, 'Everything's good in my life.' Social work often involves people at a very bad time in their life. So, for many students, prac placements are the highlight of their studies. It's where they get to put the theory they've learned into practice and experience firsthand how their chosen studies can positively impact people. All of those professions are caring professions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long students in these fields have been left to work out how they can make their pracs happen while trying to minimise the detrimental impact on their lives. Many students have been negatively impacted by having to move away from home to complete their mandatory placements. This means paying out of pocket for transport to and from the prac location, paying for accommodation while there and often buying the required uniform for the prac. Remember, sometimes these students still have to pay their own rent for the place that they are holding for the university. Many students have to give up the part-time or casual jobs that help support them at home in order to meet the requirements of their degrees. For some, it is not a choice. They simply cannot afford to undertake the prac component of their degrees—the so-called 'placement poverty'. This can result in a delay in completing the degree or not finishing it at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A first-year nurse told me that she had the opportunity to do two rural and remote placements during her degree. This is a young woman I've known since she was a little girl and who's now at university. I have obviously been here a long time. These placements often inspire graduates to move to these areas, where they're always crying out for more staff. As we know, there are lots of bush hospitals calling out for staff. Whether for nurses, teachers or social workers, there's plenty of work in the bush at the moment. Due to the lack of any financial support to undertake a placement away from home, but with the desire to experience a Western Queensland setting, this nurse self-funded her four-week prac in Charleville. She said that a prac placement payment would have made a huge difference for her. She is optimistic that the new scheme will motivate and enable many more students to have the enriching training she received and go on to inspire them to move to the bush to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure the Nats will get behind this idea of sending people to the bush with a small payment. When you consider the number of weeks that students must do of unpaid mandatory placement, you can see how the costs add up. Student teachers must do 16 weeks of prac. Student nurses must do 20 weeks, and social work students must do 26 weeks. Australia cannot afford to let these students slip through the cracks. We desperately need teachers. We need nurses, we need midwives, and we need social workers. The new Commonwealth prac payment is designed to ease the financial pressures for eligible students to undertake pracs and support these students to finish their studies and their vital degrees. The payments will start in July next year and be benchmarked at the Austudy rate of $319 per week. It will be means-tested to ensure that those who need it most will have access. The new payment has been welcomed by higher education providers, and it will support more students to finish these degrees and move into these crucial fields of work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third part of this bill's reforms concerns assisting more Australians to get into university. The bill establishes a new Commonwealth grant scheme for fee-free university-ready courses. These courses have been described as a bridge between school and university to give the students the skills that they will need at university. The Albanese Labor government is investing $350 million over four years from 1 January next year to deliver this new scheme. This includes funding for additional student places. It is estimated that the number of students participating will increase by 40 per cent by 2030. This means that around 30,000 students will be studying in fee-free university ready courses annually by 2030. The scheme will be targeted at students from under-represented backgrounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these reforms contribute to Labor's broader goal of increasing the proportion of our workforce that has completed higher education. It speaks to Labor's commitment to education and the transformative opportunities it brings. Our target is to have 80 per cent of the workforce having completed university or TAFE studies by 2050. That's quite a goal. It's good for Australians. It will be good for our economy and productivity. It feeds into a Future Made in Australia with the skills, training and opportunities for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the minister indicated, we also need to remove the artificial barrier that exists between vocational education and higher education. It benefits students and the economy if we align these sectors. This means measures such as recognition of prior learning at TAFE being counted towards a degree at university. I know the minister at the table is very enthusiastic about these challenges and opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The May budget directed $27 million into developing a more aligned higher education sector, including recognition of prior learning and more efficient regulation for dual providers, and we're working with the states to develop up to 20 centres of excellence where students can work towards certificates, diplomas and degrees together. The accord recommended oversight of the alignment of the university and TAFE sectors with the establishment of an Australian tertiary education commission. We are consulting with the sector as to how this will look and how it will operate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a lot of action taking place to set the Australian higher education system and the students of the future up for success. We're looking at a revised funding system that better meets the needs of people from disadvantaged backgrounds, enabling them to complete qualifications, and we're focusing on additional investment in public schools to ensure that more children finish high school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor understands that the pathway to better educational outcomes doesn't start at TAFE or uni. It starts with the 1.8 million Australian children who are aged zero to five, those crucial years for brain, language and social development. These years are the building blocks for good health, good education and wellbeing later in life. Labor is supporting the educators who work with this age group with a richly deserved 15 per cent wage increase over the next two years, something that I know will transform so many lives. For the people who were full-time workers who had no chance of getting into the housing market, now we can at least set some on that pathway to being able to put a roof over their head.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government knows that making our education system better and fairer for all requires initiatives, funding and programs across all ages. I've always seen education as the great transformational policy in this multicultural, egalitarian society. It's about kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and tertiary education. It's about breaking down barriers to entry and removing blocks to completing qualifications. With this bill, we're tackling some of these barriers and creating more opportunities for young Australians and for all Australians in the cities, in the towns and in the bush. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    <a href="295676" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  Thank you for the opportunity to speak on the Universities Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Bill 2024. I think I've shared in this House previously about the importance of education to me and to my family. My beloved late mother, when we were in refugee camps in Hong Kong, applied for resettlement. She told me that she wanted to apply for resettlement in this country called Uc Dai Loi, which meant Australia back then. There were two reasons she gave. One was that it was an island that was far from the conflicts that were happening in Vietnam. The second was that it had the best education system in the world. She chose and applied for resettlement here in Australia, and we were very, very lucky to be given the opportunity to be resettled here and rebuild our lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, education is the key to success. It's the passport to the future for many people, especially young people, and for the country, but more so for people of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and people that have similar shared backgrounds to me—those of us who missed the early years of education and, when we get to a country like Australia, seize the opportunity to learn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For students from socially and economically disadvantaged electorates like Fowler, the cost of education now is becoming such a big deal. It's huge. That's why, since my election, I have been calling for the freezing of the HECS indexation. I do want to acknowledge that the government took steps in this budget to change how indexation is calculated, using the lesser of the wage price index, the WPI, and the consumer price index.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As some of my fellow members in the House are aware, in late 2023 I established the Fowler Youth Advisory Committee, or FYAC for short, which consists of youths aged 16 to 24. It has given the youth in my community an opportunity to raise their voices and assist me in shaping policy. Earlier this month, we had a quarterly FYAC meeting, and one of the agenda items was their HECS debt and the increasing cost of the pursuit of higher education. So I asked the FYAC group, 'What do you and your friends think about the changes to the HELP-HECS indexation calculation that's being backdated to the 1 June 2023?' It was interesting that, out of the 12 FYAC members present, a good half answered along the lines of, 'It's good to see, but we're still accumulating debt.' Another FYAC member said, 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could revert to the Gough Whitlam days when education was free.' Now, we all know that it probably wasn't totally free, but the concern was primarily on how expensive their degrees were becoming and the indexation that they were expected to pay in the future. I can appreciate their comments. I suppose we had it easier back then, with no upfront cost, but the Gough Whitlam days are, of course, now very much behind us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past year, as I mentioned, I have relentlessly called on the government to address the spikes in HECS, and I know that some of my crossbench colleagues have done similarly. I'm pleased, and we're all pleased, to see the government has taken some sensible steps towards addressing this. But does this do anything to really support students with substantial debt? Students face HECS debt, and I have also been doorknocking in my electorate and many young students were sharing with me the cost-of-living crisis that they are experiencing, in particular in Western Sydney, where students have to travel far to study. The cost of transport has also increased, and the cost of petrol has increased for those who have to drive. Those who are renting have seen the cost of rent also increase. These young people, who are studying to get ahead in life so they can have a proper professional job and build a better future, are struggling with many other cost-of-living pressures. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The findings from the Universities Accord final report proved that there is a lot of work to be done in the education space, hence the government is now introducing this bill to implement its recommendations. As well as indexation, this bill addresses student services and amenities fees, FEE-FREE Uni Ready courses and the Commonwealth prac payment. In my Fowler electorate, over 15 per cent of constituents attend university, around seven per cent are studying for a diploma and around 22 per cent of students are currently in the high school system. So I understand how important reform of the higher education is for the future of the youth in my electorate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed legislative requirement that higher education providers allocate a minimum 40 per cent of their student services and amenities fee revenue to student led organisations is a positive approach. For socially and economically disadvantaged students, student led organisations may be able to offer support measures that allow them to have a more fulfilling tertiary education experience by providing student services and support. But what assurances can the government give that this support will be targeted at the most disadvantaged students? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What students want is more affordable higher education, but the current cost of living, as I mentioned, is not making their situation any better. A lot of students in Fowler are working part-time jobs while struggling to pay their rent, food, travel and other expenses. Students are now thinking twice and maybe even three times as to which degrees to enrol in or whether to bother at all. There's nothing inherently wrong with such consideration, but I fear that we are going to lose a generation of talented artists and creative people with the way things stand. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am disappointed that this bill makes no changes to the Morrison government's Job-ready Graduates Package, the JRG package, which used financial manipulation to incentivise students to study in areas of national priority. I don't know who made the decisions; they must have had a crystal ball. This has deterred students from studying arts courses by doubling the cost of arts degree subjects. To be frank, this is a death sentence for students who are talented in the arts and humanities, and it condemns them to the choice between a big debt or walking away because they cannot afford it. This is clear discrimination. Arts and humanities students are not less important than those pursuing a STEM degree. I understand the need to push for STEM. It's very important and something I support, but I think the arts and humanities students are also critical for the cultural growth of Australia. Along with the majority of members of this House, I studied an arts degree, which enabled me to obtain a career in the creative industry, as a writer and a journalist, which led me to where I am today. Arts and humanities degrees create future political leaders, advisers, consultants, journalists, academics, poets and musicians—the list is endless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've called on the government to consider the ramifications of the package on multiple occasions. Before the House today, I ask the government again to make changes to the JRG package, ideally scrapping it altogether—I would certainly support that. We cannot simply let this scheme continue to fail not only the generation of students facing this utilitarian discrimination but Australia as a whole. I acknowledge the government's efforts to establish a new Commonwealth prac payment, the CPP, to support students in teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work during their mandatory placements. There are 68,000 eligible students who can expect $319.50 per week during placement. It may not be much money, but it is still some money that students can use to sustain themselves while undertaking their placements. I also welcome the possibility of increasing the CPP for students, to relieve their cost-of-living tensions while undertaking placements, particularly during the spiking inflation that we are currently experiencing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about other allied health fields and sciences? Psychology, veterinary science, physiotherapy and podiatry: what provisions are available for them? I have shared in previous speeches that Fowler students in physiotherapy and podiatry feel like they are just being left out. They too must undertake practical placements as part of their course. I think it's a flawed measure to segregate other allied health fields from accessing this benefit. The government should consider what constitutes priority areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that the payments will be means tested and available only to priority areas, but this may unintentionally cause inequality, like with the JRG package. The government is essentially cherry-picking courses that they are willing to support. I really urge the Labor government to consider opening the CPP to allied health nurses. These are some of the frontline workers and people that we need in our community. I would also like to see the government clearly define how the means test will be applied. Will the means test lead to any inadvertent exclusion of students who are working part time, for example? Many students from Fowler rely on their part-time jobs to support themselves, as I mentioned earlier, through higher education. My concern is that they may be excluded under a proposed means test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this bill is a step forward, I fear it is not enough to help struggling students who need greater support as they navigate higher education. We need to get the blueprint right. If our students and allied health students are disincentivised to study, then this will place even more pressure on universities financially.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fowler Youth Advisory Committee may not have the expertise or experience to assess all of the factors involved in the funding of higher education, but they do know that, if the future offered to those who study an arts degree is one of mounting debt and high-interest payments, they will and could withdraw from higher education entirely. That is surely not the message that we want to send or the future that we want our students to aspire to.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  I speak in support of this particular piece of legislation, the Universities Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Bill 2024. We've got a good education system in this country. It can be better and a lot fairer. The previous speaker spoke about her experiences. I grew up in a working-class family in Ipswich. My dad was a cleaner in the meatworks, and my mum was a shop assistant. Neither of my parents or grandparents or anyone before them had the benefit of going to high school, let alone university. I was the first person directly in my family to ever go to high school, let alone university. It was those teachers in year 12 at Bundamba State Secondary College that gave me the aspiration, the inspiration and the opportunity to get to university and be the first person from my high school ever to study law. That gave me the chance to go to university.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm completely aware of the value and the contribution of the Labor Party and the trade union movement, my family and friends and, of course, my constituents who voted me in again and again, but I believe I would not be here if not for the brilliance of teachers and for the fairness and opportunity that were given to me as a young fellow in Trumper Street in East Ipswich, at the back of a flood ridden house, and at the back of a school in a working-class battling community in Ipswich. Education raised my expectations and gave me a chance to be in this place and to build with my fellow directors and shareholders a multimillion-dollar business that operated for the whole time I was in business as a lawyer in the Brisbane CBD. So education changes lives. Education lifts people up, such as battling kids in regional and rural communities and in working-class communities like the one in which I grew up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The big hike in HECS-HELP debts last year hit a lot of Australians hard, particularly young Australians. We heard their voices and we're acting on it. These changes require passing legislation, and introducing this bill brings us one step closer to reform. We're introducing legislation to make the system fairer and improve the way indexation is calculated for the HELP system. Once this bill passes, it's going to wipe out $3 billion in HELP debt for more than three million Australians. And we're going a step further and backdating it to 1 June last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces a Commonwealth prac payment to give eligible people who've signed up to do some of the most important jobs in our country a bit of extra help for the qualifications they need. I can't describe how important this is for regional and rural communities. I've represented most of the country towns in my area. I think Deputy Speaker Buchholz and I have represented a fair bit together at various times, with him crossing over after me after redistributions. I can say that, in those rural communities and regional areas in South-East Queensland that I've had the honour and privilege to represent, there are so many young people who would like to go to TAFE or university and study certain courses, but one of the barriers for them is the fact that they have to do months and months of prac work. And that's good because, if you want to become a teacher, social worker, nurse, midwife or early education teacher, it's crucial you do that prac work, but the challenges of geography are matched by the challenges of finance for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will massively expand the fee-free Uni Ready courses, which also act as a bridge for students in those regional communities who aspire to go to university. These courses help Australians get a go and have a crack at university. It amends the Higher Education Support Act to implement the first stage of the Universities Accord. I've spoken to the University of Southern Queensland. I've got the privilege of having two campuses in my electorate, with one at Springfield and one at Ipswich. That accord was led by Professor Mary O'Kane AC. The Universities Accord was the biggest and broadest review of the higher education system that we've seen in 15 years. The final report was released on 25 February this year. It's a blueprint for higher education reform. There are 47 recommendations, 29 of which the government has agreed to implement in full or part in this year's budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, the bill makes the HECS-HELP system fairer by improving the way indexation is calculated. That will impact 23,000 people in my electorate. Just imagine that: 23,000 people. That number sounds like a lot. If you were to put them in Suncorp Stadium, imagine how full Suncorp Stadium would be. About half the stadium would be filled. That's just in my electorate alone, one of 151 electorates in this chamber. This is going to help a lot of people and their families. The 23,000 is just the individuals concerned. If you add their families, well more than 50,000 people in my electorate alone will be benefiting from this change. The new methodology is really critical and goes back to 1 June last year. It's going to apply to all HELP loans, VET Student Loans, Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans and other student support loans and ensure that outstanding loans never grow faster than the average wage. Up to 68,000 people will benefit from the Commonwealth prac payment that I've talked about. That's for the nursing, teaching, midwifery and social work students. That will make a big impact in regional Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, the bill establishes a new Commonwealth grant system, funding a cluster for fee-free Uni Ready courses, which act as a bridge between school and university to provide foundational support. And I'll come to that soon. The bill effectively uncaps fee-free university-ready courses across Australia, helping students make the jump to university.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourth, the bill supports students by requiring higher education providers to allocate a minimum of 40 per cent of their student services and amenities fee revenue to student led education organisations, ensuring the students have a significant role in deciding how their services and amenities fees are spent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is crucial. The legislation is the first step in our reform agenda, and it's critical work that we're undertaking. As I said before, these are the most extensive changes we've seen. The government set a national target of 80 per cent of the workforce having a tertiary education by 2050. I can remember how few students graduated from high school just a generation ago. We're lifting our aspirations from high school to university. If the broader accord targets are achieved, about $240 billion in additional income will be added to the economy over the period to 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got many changes in this bill. We're developing a new managed-growth funding system for Commonwealth supported places to meet student demand and support sustainable growth and increased opportunity, particularly for people from underrepresented backgrounds like my own. We'll make needs based funding a core component of funding for higher education teaching and learning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can remember when the Liberals and the National Party linked funding to WorkChoices under John Howard's reign and regime. I can remember that they'd linked university funding and that they had to bring in those workplace agreements. The only way universities would get the funding they needed is if they put AWAs in. That's the attitude of those opposite in relation to university funding. Once the party of Menzies, who valued education, they thought, 'We'll use higher education to impose our ideological right-wing agenda,' and they haven't changed. They've still got the same mentality. You can still see it from those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're going to fund a number of organisations—for example, Charles Darwin University to establish and operate a new medical school in the Northern Territory, subject to the finalisation of exploratory work. We're commissioning an independent strategic examination of research and development across government. There are a whole range of reforms that we're undertaking in relation to that. We've established an implementation advisory committee to undertake further engagement with the sector to inform legislative design of the Australian Tertiary Education Commission and new managed growth funding system. The advisory committee is being chaired by Tony Cook PSM, the secretary of the Department of Education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing we're undertaking which I think has got real benefit—and I've been speaking to the minister's office and the minister personally about it—is the proposal to establish a network of suburban university study hubs. This is where it comes in, giving more people from the outer suburbs of major cities an opportunity for tertiary education. We're investing $66.9 million to double the number of university study hubs across the country and bring those hubs to the outer suburbs of our major cities for the very first time. This builds on the 34 existing regional university study hubs located across the country, which support 4,000 students. Of those 10 regional university study hubs recently funded—that's in response, by the way, to the Australian Universities Accord interim report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're going to establish these suburban university study hubs in areas without a significant university campus and where there are low rates of university qualification. The hubs will provide safe spaces for students, including those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, First Nations students, people with disability and people from multicultural communities. This is also where it's critical for my electorate. They'll provide computer facilities, internet and study spaces as well as in-person administrative and academic skills support for tertiary students. Applications have now closed. I know I've encouraged the University of Southern Queensland to apply for a network of hubs across Ipswich, Logan and south-west Brisbane as part of this process. I've attended a number of roundtables with the University of Southern Queensland and Griffith University, as well as councils across South-East Queensland and other stakeholders, to discuss this proposal. It's very exciting for South-East Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Too often, someone's postcode is a brick wall that stops them from going to university, with the cost of moving closer to a campus being a major disincentive to study. The postcode you live in shouldn't be a barrier to getting a degree. The opportunity to go to university is life changing, particularly in regions like mine and particularly across Ipswich. Our suburban university study hubs will provide support close to home. The discussions I've been involved in with local stakeholders have identified a number of possible sites, including Redbank Plains in Ipswich—a very multicultural community and the biggest suburb in Ipswich. Applications are now going to be evaluated in relation to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for TAFE or university qualifications is growing, and more people in the workforce will be required to upskill and reskill. Almost one in two young people in their 20s and 30s have university degrees, but not in my community—not in Blair. This has to change, because in the decade ahead more and more jobs will require TAFE or university qualifications. As I've said before, I was the first person in my family to go to high school, let alone university, and I want to see more young people in Ipswich and the Somerset region get the opportunities that I did. One way to do it is by providing higher education services closer to home, closer to the students, and providing that financial support for them when they are doing prac. It's bringing education and financial support to the students where they're located.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm excited that we're doing this. This bill is a very important piece of legislation for my community and particularly for regional communities and outer suburban communities. I am very keen to see one or more of these suburban hubs established in my electorate. This will help, for example, young people in Logan, Ipswich and south-west Brisbane, across electorates like Oxley, Rankin and Blair, which we on this side of the chamber have the honour to represent—and also the electorate of Wright, Deputy Speaker Buchholz. It will help people in the Lockyer Valley, which I used to represent and which you represent now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I want to acknowledge the Minister for Education for bringing forward these reforms. These are major changes. We sometimes don't quite realise, when we're debating legislation, the kind of impact this will have. This is not legislation that will be forgotten. This legislation that we are debating today will have impacts on people for generations. People's lives will be changed by the bill that we are going to pass. They will be changed, their families will be changed and their generations will be changed. That's how important this legislation is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank our government officials and public servants who worked on this legislation—the whole Universities Accord team. I've read this report. It's an excellent report, and I commend it to anyone to read. I want to thank all the stakeholders for their valuable input in these reforms. This is about building a better but also a fairer system. It's not just about supporting rich schools; it's about filling universities with kids from low-socioeconomic backgrounds—the Bradley reforms, as we used to call them years ago. This legislation will help with the cost of degrees and the cost of living, and it will help a lot of young people—and older people too—who would have missed out on opportunities in life—that ladder of opportunity, which we often talk about. This legislation is absolutely vital, but it's only the first step in what the Albanese Labor government is doing to assist young people in the outer suburbs and the regions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Brisbane has one of the youngest populations in the entire country. We are home to many, many university campuses, including very large university campuses, with thousands of students and countless young people starting out in the world post graduation. At the same time, though, we are a community with over $1 billion of student debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Student debt is making the cost-of-living crisis worse and is damaging our economy, in the now and over the long term. As the cost of going to university creeps higher and higher, people are concerned about their futures. Many constituents have told me that the soaring costs of going to university are making them question whether or not they should continue at uni, with some just writing it off as an option altogether. Education should be free at the point of use. It should be the same for early childhood, primary, secondary and higher education, to break cycles of poverty, allow people to pursue their dreams, improve our economy and allow people to specialise their skills or even retrain as our economy changes in the future. Education that is free at the point of use gives people economic freedom and social mobility. We need to make uni free again, and we need to wipe all student debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us today seeks to do a few things—namely, to tweak and amend the HECS debt system. It retrospectively ties the student debt indexation rate to the lower of either the CPI—the consumer price index—or the WPI, the wage price index, and provides an indexation credit to reduce the 2023 and 2024 student debt indexation rates from 7.1 per cent to 3.2 per cent and from 4.7 per cent to four per cent, respectively. In short, someone who has an average student debt $26½ thousand will see a reduction of around $1,200 in their outstanding student debt as a result of these changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But setting indexation to the lower of the CPI or the WPI is akin to arranging deckchairs on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Titanic</span>. The WPI is usually higher than the CPI, so this change will make little difference. In fact, in the last 25 years the WPI has been lower than CPI indexation only four times, including in 2022 and 2023. Big student debt indexation hikes can still happen. Student debts will keep going up. In fact, even after these changes, student debt will have risen by over 10 per cent in Labor's first term in government. We keep hearing that Labor is wiping $3 billion of student debt, but when you put that up against the $78 billion of student debt in this country it really is just a drop in the ocean.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Making university free once again and wiping student debt would forever change this country for the better. It would send a signal that we value education as a public good that everyone should have equal access to, regardless of their financial standing. It would make us a more prosperous country. Universities Australia recently noted that university educated workers make our economy $185 billion bigger and underpin a higher standard of living for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Free university courses would boost our economy, reduce economic inequality and give countless more people the opportunity to follow their passions. We wouldn't even be trying something new. University used to be free in this country, and it still is free in numerous countries around the world: France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark—the list goes on and on. But right now we see university courses becoming more and more expensive. Student debt is growing larger and larger each year, and next year punitive fee hikes that were ushered in by the Morrison government—which Labor is refusing to change in this bill, I'll add, despite the recommendation on the Universities Accord panel—will kick in, and some degrees will cost more than $53,000. Allowing Australia to continue down this path is bad for the economy and it is bad for our society. We keep hearing that a university degree today is what a high school certificate was 30 years ago. If that is the case, we have to act like it. We need to make university free and wipe all student debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also allows for grants to be paid to higher education providers for the new Commonwealth placement payment. This payment is $319.50 per week for eligible teaching, nursing and social work students—$319.50 a week. Students are expected to be studying full-time while doing placements up to full-time while also paying for groceries, ever-increasing rent and all their other bills. It is impossible. I want to share the story of my sister, Emily, who had to go through unpaid placement through her time studying to be a midwife. In her first few years of studying nursing and midwifery she had to complete two eight-hour days of placement, one eight-hour day of uni lectures and one eight-hour day of tutorials, totalling 32 hours of unpaid university-required learning and placement. This left her with the ability to work one shift per week at her job so that she also had enough time to study and complete assignments so that she could pass the course.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Her final year of study saw her doing 32 hours of unpaid placement a week, including night shifts. On top of this were the continuity-of-care shifts, where students were required to follow expectant parents through their antenatal visits, births and postnatal visits. Emily needed to complete 20 of these, regardless of the day and regardless of the time. She was essentially on call 24/7, unpaid. Because of this, Emily did not have time to also work a job that actually paid her. So she couldn't afford a car. She couldn't afford a place to rent in Brisbane without our family helping her. And this was back in 2017. Adding in the current cost-of-living and housing crises, I genuinely do not know how we expect anyone to be able to make this work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's proposal of $319.50 a week is not enough. It is $8 an hour if you are doing a full-time placement. Students experiencing placement poverty need urgent relief. Labor has said this policy will only commence on 1 July next year, so what are people supposed to do in the interim? Every student should be paid for every hour of work that they're required to do as part of their degree, yet the government is excluding so many of them. Students should be paid at least the minimum wage for work on their placement, not a lesser supplementary amount. Wiping $3 billion out of $78 billion of student debt is measly and does not address the systemic issue of charging people to receive an education. Again, $319.50 a week for working a full-time placement is woefully low, and so many students in key fields like medicine and psychology completely miss out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need an overhaul of the way we do higher education in this country. We are left playing catch-up to so many economies who already experience the huge benefits of providing free university. But yet again it comes down to a matter of priorities. It is a choice of this government, of both major parties, and the priorities of this place are out of touch with the people out there in the community. There is always money for tax handouts to the mega-wealthy and there's always money for the fossil fuel industry. That enormous expenditure is never questioned. But when it comes time to fund education, to take a bold and courageous step towards creating a more equal and fair society and fair economy, the message from the major parties is that it's just too expensive. We keep hearing that a university degree, like I said, is now worth what a high school certificate was worth 30 years ago. If that is the case, we need to act like it in this place. We need to make university free once again, and we need to wipe all student debt.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  Education is everything. It matters enormously to the families in the electorate of Chisholm, which I am so privileged to represent. I'm so pleased to be part of a government that takes education and higher education seriously and understands the opportunities that can be accessed through a university degree and a course of study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an area I am absolutely passionate about. In my very first speech in this place, I spoke about my commitment to and experience of working in the higher education sector. I'm delighted that in our very first term we are making some important changes to make it easier for people to access education in communities right across Australia, including of course in my wonderful community of Chisholm, which is home to Monash University and Deakin University. Monash University is where I was able to undertake my first degree. It was always the local university and an important part of our community, where my school concerts and ballet concerts took place. I know that so many families move into the south-eastern and eastern suburbs because of the connection to excellent schools and terrific higher education institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms in this bill, the Universities Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Bill 2024, really matter to my community of Chisholm. I undertook a survey throughout the accord consultation process in my electorate and I received hundreds and hundreds of responses. Locals wanted to see—and this came through incredibly clearly in responses—a fairer, more affordable and accessible education system. I made a submission on behalf of my electorate to the accord expert panel, and I'm so pleased that the voices of the people of Chisholm have been heard. The reforms we are getting on with implementing are exactly the sorts of reforms my electorate wants to see from our government. I've heard from students, from academics, from parents and from grandparents—even parents of children in primary school, parents who are already thinking about the education they want to set their young children up with for life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is making a really serious commitment to higher education, putting in place significant reforms in response to the Australian Universities Accord, which in itself was a really important process to undertake and which will provide cost-of-living relief and make higher education better and fairer for students, including those of low-SES or disadvantaged backgrounds and those from the outer suburbs and regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill enacts many of the important changes announced in the 2024-25 budget. We're making HECS-HELP fairer for all Australians and wiping around $3 billion in student debt for three million Australians. This has been incredibly well received in my community, especially, as I mentioned, following the enormous number of responses to our survey and the clear community view that we need to make university more affordable for people right across Australia. What this means is that someone with an average HECS debt of about $26,500 will see that debt cut by about $1,200.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time ever, the Commonwealth will introduce a prac payment to support teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students to do their mandatory placements. Again, the need to do this came through very strongly through the consultation that I've had in my community—with families, students, practitioners and the universities themselves. I'm really pleased that we're the first government to take this really important step because we want to make it easier for people to get a qualification, to get a job and to be able to contribute to our communities in these very important professions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that many students have said that when they do the prac component of the degree they've got some really difficult financial decisions to make. Unfortunately, we know that some people have had to give up their part-time jobs or have had to move away from home, and, regrettably, for a lot of people this has meant that they've delayed finishing their degrees or have disconnected from study altogether and not completed their degrees at all. It's so important that we've removed the obstacles that have prevented people from being able to be successful through their studies in these incredibly important areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know we need more teachers, more nurses, more midwives and more social workers. These are some of the most important jobs in this country. These are the people who will teach our children, look after people when they're sick and old, help women during childbirth, and support people in some of the most difficult times in their lives, when they may have experienced family and domestic violence. This is vital work across all of the communities that every representative in this place has the privilege of being elected to speak on behalf of. This is really important legislation, and this prac payment provides the support for people to continue with the training that they need to complete in order to be qualified in their chosen area of study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also uncap the FEE-FREE Uni Ready Courses right across the country so that more people get the skills they need to start a degree. This is about unlocking opportunity, because, on this side of the House, we believe that everyone should be able to pursue all kinds of possibilities and potential, no matter where they're from and no matter how much they or their parents have earned. These courses—these FEE-FREE Uni Ready Courses—are effectively a bridge between school and university, to help people get the skills they need and to help them to succeed once they get to university. These changes are expected to increase the number of people doing these free uni-ready courses by about 40 per cent—that's so significant—by the end of the decade and to double the number in the decade after that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also mandates that higher education providers allocate at least 40 per cent of student services and amenities fees to student led organisations. This will strengthen student led organisations and their ability to act in the best interests of all students. This is really important and empowering for students. Again, this need to do more to allow student voices to be heard came through very strongly in the survey I undertook in my electorate of Chisholm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government have been working really hard to make sure we address the issue of gender inequality in this country and, of course, we have seen that there has been a historic reduction in the gender pay gap recently. This bill also addresses gender inequality in this country. Sixty-one per cent of HELP debtors are women, which is around 1.8 million people. They are going to benefit from the measures contained in this legislation. The Commonwealth prac payment primarily supports female dominated occupations. Women make up 88 per cent of people in nursing, 75 per cent of people in teaching and 85 per cent of people in social work. We know that in our fee-free Uni Ready courses, over 60 per cent of the people who will benefit are women. They will benefit from the additional places and funding for delivery of these courses. So in this legislation, as across much of our legislation that we as a government have introduced, we see gender equality is at the heart of what we do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is significant that we are wiping around $3 billion in student debt for more than three million Australians. This will ease pressure on workers and students right across the country, providing significant relief for students while continuing to protect the integrity and value of the HELP and other student loan systems which have allowed government to massively expand tertiary access for Australians and to allow more Australians, therefore, to go to university and to seize the opportunities that a university education and degree provides. This bill caps the HELP indexation rate to the lower of either the consumer price index or the wage price index. Importantly, we back dated these changes to 1 June 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once the legislation passes, individuals will receive a credit to their outstanding student loan debt balance for the difference between the indexation rate under the current legislation and the new indexation rate. These changes cover HELP, VET student loans, Australian apprenticeship support loans and other student loan accounts that existed on 1 June last year. This will benefit all Australians with a student loan and fix the issue of last year's spike in the CPI indexation rate of 7.1 per cent and prevent growth in debt from outpacing wages in the future. This is a step that really demonstrates our commitment to fairness in the higher education loan system. This change is going to provide important relief for students while continuing to protect the HELP system and to enable people to defer their debt and study at university.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am really proud to be part of a government that takes higher education seriously, that sees the benefit for our communities in making sure that education is inclusive, accessible and equitable. As I said in my first speech in this place and will continue to advocate for long after I leave this place, I believe that higher education and education more broadly unlocks opportunities. It is everything, I know families in my electorate sacrifice so much so that their children can receive a high-quality education. I will always defend education, from the earliest years to the possibilities through lifelong learning. I know that this side of the House, the Albanese Labor government, will always back education and do everything it can to protect and enhance the system we have in Australia.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WATSON-BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  There are deep systemic problems that are crippling our Australian tertiary education system and thereby the students within it. This is a huge issue in my electorate of Ryan, which is proudly the home of the University of Queensland. The government pats itself on the back. There's been a fair bit of self-congratulation from the government benches today for wiping $3 billion in HECS debt. But let's be crystal clear: this debt wouldn't even have existed if they had scrapped indexation last year. Instead they let indexation continue, leading to debts skyrocketing by 7.1 per cent last year and over four per cent this year. This isn't generosity. This is gaslighting again. Three billion dollars of debt relief is a tiny drop in the vast ocean of a $78 billion debt. To put this into perspective, if you have an average student debt of $26½ thousand it will reduce by only $1,200, once only.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine this—and I'm going to paint a rather sad picture here. You go to uni, you work hard and you try to get a good job. As punishment, your HECS debt grows faster than you can pay it off, because of indexation. It's a trap that's locking people out of the housing market, delaying families and crushing dreams of higher education. We all agree that higher education is absolutely critical to the health of our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about Labor's so-called fix? They want to set indexation to the lower of CPI or WPI, but here's the catch: WPI is usually higher than CPI, so this change will make little difference. In fact, in the last 25 years, WPI has been lower than CPI only four times. Labor's tweaks will not provide an ounce of relief to those struggling under ballooning debts in this cost-of-living crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The root of the student debt crisis remains untouched. People are graduating with bigger and bigger debts that grow every year and take longer to pay off, thanks to the LNP's disgraceful punitive fee hikes—hikes that Labor is backing against the advice of their own uni accords panel. Next year, for the first time ever, arts degrees will cost more than $50,000. We have Labor to thank for that. Let's be real here. The student debt system cannot be fixed, because student debt shouldn't exist in the first place. Higher education, like all education, is an essential public good that should be free, universal and provided by the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're one of the thousands of students who are required to attend a placement for your degree, you can expect an even greater financial burden. Tens of thousands of students across the country are working for free in unpaid placements, leaving them unable to work to support themselves. This is nonsensical; it's cruel. You shouldn't have to choose between study and paying the rent, and that's the case for so many millions of students right now. You certainly shouldn't have to choose between studying in an absolutely essential field, like nursing, midwifery or social work, or fields with drastic workforce shortages, like medicine or veterinary science, and putting food on the table. That's the situation for way too many students at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of all this is that only those with more privileged backgrounds, or those who have substantial savings, can actually put themselves through these degrees. It's disgraceful, and it's not the way to invest in the future of this country. Labor once again claims to be doing something about this, but it's barely touching the sides of this crisis. Students in the fields of nursing, teaching and social work will be lucky enough to benefit from a below-minimum-wage, means-tested placement payment of about $8 an hour, and they'll have to wait until July 2025 to get this payment. It was announced in this year's budget—the one with a surplus—and could already have been introduced, but Labor has chosen to extend the suffering of these students, forcing them to keep making these impossible choices for another 12 months. Which degrees don't get this payment at all? It's a really long list but it includes medical students, who have to do 2,000 hours of placement; vet students, who have to do 52 weeks of placement; and people studying radiography, psychology, physiotherapy and occupational therapy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At $8 an hour for a 40-hour week, it comes to $320, which is, put simply, not enough to live on. I can guarantee you that none of the MPs in this place would be able to live on that, yet they're happy to condemn others to do it. Three hundred and twenty dollars a week is well below the poverty line, as we know. It's certainly not enough to live on when students are staring down the barrel of yearly, unlimited rent increases in most of the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To add insult to injury, Labor and the LNP have refused to rein in corporate price gouging, sending the cost of groceries through the roof. It's just cruel. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is currently trumpeting its Future Made in Australia Bill. For a truly thriving and viable future for everyone made in Australia, we need to properly invest in the education of Australians. I urge Labor to make that good investment, which should not be regarded as a cost. That good investment would see huge returns for Australia and Australians for generations to come.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>):  Higher education is essential for our economy and the future of our nation. Gough Whitlam said it best in his 1969 election pitch:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are all diminished when any of us are denied proper education. The nation is the poorer—a poorer economy, a poorer civilisation because of this human and national waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, 36 per cent of our workforce holds a university degree. Our education system is strong, but we can and must do more to make it even better. The future of Australia hinges on our ability to educate and empower the next generation. It is not just about filling classrooms; it is about equipping our people with skills and knowledge and the opportunity to thrive in a rapidly changing world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2022, the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, initiated a generational review of the higher education sector. This ambitious review, known as the Australian Universities Accord, involved extensive consultation with students, industry leaders, universities and staff across the sector. The goal was clear: to create a fairer and more equitable higher education system. The accord set an ambitious target to have 80 per cent of the workforce achieve a tertiary qualification by 2050. This is not just a great aspiration, it is a practical and necessary goal that will help Australia remain competitive in a global economy. Achieving this target will add an estimated $240 billion dollars to our economy by 2050—a significant boost that will benefit all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Universities Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Bill 2024 is a crucial step forward in realising this vision. This bill addresses four key priorities outlined in the Universities Accord. One, it will wipe out approximately $3 billion of HECS debt for over three million Australians. Education should be a pathway to opportunity, not a road to a lifetime of debt. This is why Labor is wiping out $3 billion in student debt and changing the indexation of loans so that student loans will never increase faster than wages. For someone with an average HECS debt of about $26,500, this change will mean a reduction of around $1,200. For someone with a debt of $45,000, it will mean a reduction of around $2,000. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not just about numbers; it is about providing real relief to real people. In Holt alone, this change will benefit 19,600 people with student debt. This week, the Manager of Opposition Business stated that the coalition welcomes an initiative to combat escalating student debt. While it's heartening to hear this support now, it is unfortunate that he did not show this concern when he voted with the previous government to support the Job Ready Graduates package, which increased the cost of arts, business and commerce degrees. This this was the peak of a series of attempts by the previous Liberal-National government to deregulate university fees and make students bear more of the cost. Every time Labor have been in government, we have pursued policies to support students. Every time the coalition have been in power, they have waged an ideological war against our higher education system, making it more expensive and less accessible for students. We believe that education is a public good, not a privilege reserved for the few. This is why Labor governments have always supported policies to enable more students to study and which support them to complete their degree.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time, the Commonwealth will introduce a prac payment to support teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students during their placements. These are fields in high demand, which focus on caring for others, caring for our young Australians, caring for our mental wellbeing, caring for our mothers during childbirth and caring for the sick. These students are the future of our essential services, and it is our responsibility to support them as they prepare to take on these crucial roles. I have spoken to hundreds of students across Victoria about the need for this payment. From RMIT to Deakin, Monash to Melbourne, Swinburne to VU and La Trobe to Federation University, students have shared their struggles to afford basic essentials like petrol and rent while trying to complete their studies. Many of these students must dip into their savings to undertake hundreds of hours of unpaid work, which is particularly challenging for those who live away from home and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This is why we are making this change. From July 2025, these students will be paid $319 per week while undertaking their placements. This payment will not only provide much-needed financial support but will also encourage more students to pursue these fulfilling and essential careers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a significant jump between high school and university, and it is our duty to ensure that these students are adequately prepared for this transition. This bill uncaps fee-free university-ready courses. These courses serve as a bridge between school and university, helping students gain the skills they need to succeed in higher education. They teach students writing, communications, maths and other foundational skills that they need to prosper at university, whether they do not achieve the entry score or are looking to upskill later in life. The Albanese Labor government is investing $350 million to expand these programs. This fund will allow 40 per cent more students to undertake these courses by 2030 and will double the number of students by that time. These programs are especially important for the underrepresented and disadvantaged communities who may otherwise be locked out of our higher education system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Students know what is best for students, which is why our government is guaranteeing funding for student-led organisations. These organisations provide vital services on campus, including independent advocacy, training, financial aid, legal services and wellbeing programs like food banks and mental health outreach. They are run by students for students. They are the best informed and equipped to represent the interests and needs of the student body. Student organisations have done fantastic work over the last decade, bringing vital issues on campus to light. They have held institutions accountable when they have failed to act on issues such as sexual assault and harassment. In 2008, the former Minister for Youth Kate Ellis released a report into the impact of voluntary student—</span>

Back when I was first appointed as the Special Envoy for the Great Barrier Reef, in 2019, I was determined to work closely with the scientific community rather than with the activists. Initially I was hesitant, when Dr Waters requested a meeting, to meet with her, but I'm so glad that I agreed. Meeting with Dr Waters and learning about her organisation was truly an enlightening experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Divers for Climate is an amazing organisation comprised of divers from our tourism industry predominantly—individuals who have spent much of their time with their heads under the water, witnessing firsthand the beauty and the challenges facing our reefs. What sets them apart is their balanced approach to advocacy. They're not just raising the alarm on the challenges that we face; they're also highlighting the significant advances and successes in preserving our precious marine environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must acknowledge the challenges, certainly, but we also must celebrate the successes and progress being made. For this, I congratulate Dr Waters and her team from Divers for Climate. They bring a level of credibility and balanced advocacy that is utterly refreshing, and I look forward to seeing more of what they will accomplish well into the future.</span>

When the Albanese government came to office, Australians were losing more than $3 billion a year to scams. The opposition had sat on their hands and done nothing while scam losses doubled and doubled again. That trend has now flipped thanks to the tough approach Labor has taken, with scam losses reducing for the first time in nearly a decade—down by half a billion dollars in 2023 compared to 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's down, but it's still way too high. We know anyone can be the victim of a scam. ASIC has found that, while recent data suggests Australians are becoming better at identifying and reporting scams, we need continued focus across industry and regulators to effectively tackle this insidious issue. We're doing more. We invested another $67.5 million in the recent budget to combat scams and online fraud. One change will be industry-specific mandatory codes to hold every industry to account with heavy penalties and strong regulator enforcement if they're non-compliant. We'll start with banks, telcos and digital platforms. They'll be required to have measures in place to prevent, detect, disrupt, stop and report scams. Remember: if you fear you're being scammed, speak up and seek help.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  I'd like to congratulate Tuncurry local Cliff Gralton, who has secured a place in the 2024 Australian Irukandjis para surfing team. Last week Cliff won the prone 2 class at the Australian para surfing titles held at North Haven. That was the highest single wave score in the whole division, and it has allowed him to now enter the world championships.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cliff will travel with his small support team to California's famous Huntington Beach to represent his country in these world championships. Cliff and his wife, Jess, currently have a GoFundMe page to help fund Cliff and his team's journey to the US. So get out there, people, and support Cliff. What a massive achievement. Congratulations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to wish Tuncurry resident Dorothy Cordery a very happy 96 birthday. Dorothy made the move from Sydney to begin her working life. She met her husband, John, when she started working. They moved to the Great Lakes about 40 years ago and have run many hospitality businesses. She is now a much-loved great-grandmother. I hope she has a wonderful birthday. Ninety-six is a great achievement. Keep on going strong. Hopefully, we'll be standing here and wishing you a happy 100th birthday in a few years time.</span>

I am thrilled that more than 24,000 households and businesses in Holt can now benefit from direct fibre to the home thanks to the Albanese Labor government's NBN upgrade program. The government is investing $2.4 billion over four years to deliver an additional 1.5 million fibre connections across our nation, offering speeds of up to one gigabyte per second. Whether you're watching Netflix, FaceTiming family or running a business from home, these upgrades will provide speeds 18 times faster than the average copper connections. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Residents across Holt, including Hampton Park, Narre Warren South, Lynbrook, Lyndhurst, Cranbourne, Clyde, Clyde North, Botanic Ridge, Junction Village, Pearcedale, Tooradin, Blind Bight and Warneet, will all benefit. Good internet is just as important as running water. These upgrades are essential to keep us competitive in a modern digital world. By the end of 2025, 90 per cent of homes in Holt will have access to download speeds of up to one gigabyte per second thanks to the Albanese Labor government.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I rise today to honour the late Olga Horak OAM, a Holocaust survivor and passionate educator who passed away last week at the age of 98. Olga was a survivor of Auschwitz and Bergen Belsen. Born in 1926 in Czechoslovakia, Olga's life changed dramatically with the outbreak of World War II. In 1944, when Olga was just 16, she and her family were deported to Auschwitz. Her father and sister were sent directly to the gas chambers, and Olga and her mother were subjected to horrific conditions and forced labour. That bitter winter, Olga and her mother were forced to march for hundreds of kilometres and were then transported to Bergen Belsen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite suffering from typhus and diphtheria, she survived to see Bergen Belsen liberated on 15 April 1945. Tragically, her mother died a day later. Olga was the sole survivor of her family. Two years later, Olga met her future husband, John Horak, who was also a survivor. In 1949, Olga and John arrived in Sydney to begin a new life, and they became active members of Australian society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Olga dedicated her life to educating others about the Holocaust and ensuring the memories of those who perished were never forgotten. Olga's work at the Sydney Jewish Museum, where she volunteered for decades, touched countless lives. Her words are so important. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Do not hate. Respect people. Have dialogue with people from different backgrounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are words that we all need to live by now. I pay my respects to Olga, her family and the enormous contribution she made to the Sydney Jewish Museum and the Association of Jewish Holocaust Survivors and Descendants, of which she was a patron.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  There are moments in this place that transcend the cut and thrust of political discourse. This week, we had two of those moments, thanks to the valedictory speeches of the members for Gorton and Barton. They've lived incredible lives of service, and we have all benefited. They have also shown us that you can serve in this place with compassion and grace. Unfortunately, this parliamentary fortnight, we've also seen the very worst of our political discourse when the debate in this place descended into divisive political opportunism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen this kind of politics in Australia before, and we are seeing it around the world. Smearing and labelling an entire community is a sad but all-too-familiar political playbook. But politics doesn't have to be this way. It doesn't have to be a gladiatorial sport where we punch down on others. The Leader of the Opposition may land some political blows when he is in this place, using those tactics, but the people who really feel the blows are those out in our communities. The members for Barton and Gorton have shown what can be achieved when we show each other humanity instead of intolerance and prejudice. It's their example that I will follow.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Today I rise to pay tribute to the incredible work of the Mudgee Evening Branch of the Country Women's Association. With 34 devoted members, this group works tirelessly for the community, including by raising funds for local charities. Their current focus is on raising $38,000 to furnish two rooms at Macquarie Home Stay in Dubbo, which provides affordable accommodation for patients receiving treatment at Dubbo's hospital. Recently, the group raised more than $8,000 at the Mudgee Small Farm Field Days by serving baked goods, sandwiches, soups, tea and coffee at their marquee stand in the pavilion, and I really enjoyed catching up with the team at this year's field days.</span>

Their work is supported by cultural officer Sue Le Bas, agriculture and environment officer Katie Dobson, international officer Sue Munns, land cookery officer Lynn Halpin, handicraft officer Melinda Leach, publicity officer Jaclyn Harvey, and catering officer and property manager Annie Johnston. I give special mention also to young members Eliza and Mia Halpin, who ran pre-ordered lunches to other stallholders. Well done to all the members of the CWA Mudgee Evening Branch for their hard work and dedication to making our communities and our world a better place.</span>

Through the purchase of a daffodil or a pin, or by making a donation, the work of the Cancer Council to support those with a cancer diagnosis and their families is made possible. The Cancer Council funds breakthrough research, raises awareness and provides compassionate and practical support across Australia. With one in two Australians being diagnosed with cancer by the age of 85, we all know someone or, indeed, may be someone who has been directly impacted by cancer.</span>

Eden generously shared her story of a recent cancer diagnosis and the journey she is now on. Eden is determined, was diagnosed early and has so much love and support from the community as she fights this disease. Eden, we stand with you. This Daffodil Day, if you are able to show your support, please do. I commend the work the Cancer Council does every single day.</span>

At the moment, they are going through what is called a 'green drought'. This is having implications, whether they be in the west of my electorate with our sheep and beef farmers around Marino and Digby, or in the south-west with the dairy farmers in and around the Simpson area. They are suffering from a lack of water, and it's a lack of water which has been below average for nearly 18 months now.</span>

I say to the new agriculture minister: please have a look at this. Talk to the Victorian state government. The way the process works is the Victoria state government should be making an application on behalf of my farmers to get them the assistance that they need, but so far nothing is happening. I ask the agricultural Minister: pick up the phone and find out what is happening on the ground in western Victoria, because farmers need help at this time. If we don't get rain over the spring, it's going to get worse and worse. Please, do your bit.</span>

I watched as some of the junior boys and girls teams trained in the sport they love. With more than 1,000 members, this club is one of the largest in Western Australia. To play hockey at a high level this stadium needed new lights. I'm proud to have delivered on one of my electoral commitments to contribute to this upgrade. With training every night of the week, and weekend games that go into the evening, the lighting upgrade was necessary for the club to continue its growth. The new lighting is more energy efficient, and the club can now host more high-level events as well as live stream out of the facility.</span>

I watched the junior coach season where they train at a place where an upgrade of a new glass front wall was done. This is another election commitment I am proud to have contributed and delivered. As a big part of the local community, I can't wait to see how this fantastic club continues to grow.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Recently I was contacted by an old schoolmate of mine who was a local police officer in Caboolture and has now been stationed in Northern Queensland for around 20 years. He contacted me and said that he'd had a real breakthrough with improving the kids' behaviour in the town where he was stationed by organising a regular rugby league team amongst them all. But they faced the problem of no boots for these kids because most just couldn't afford them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I sent an SOS out a few of the local clubs and businesses in the Longman community. I'm pleased to report that about two weeks later I was able to send four large crates containing around a hundred footy boots to this community. This was thanks to the wonderful generosity of the Burpengary Jets Junior Rugby League Club, who rallied the parents who in turn donated boots, that in many cases were near new because, as we know, teenagers grow out of their boots pretty quickly and, sadly, many times these boots in great condition just end up in the bin. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to shout out to INTERSPORT at Morayfield, a locally owned and operated business who generously gave these kids four brand new pairs of boots still in their boxes. This has inspired me to start a program that will encourage people to drop used boots in good condition into crates and I will supply these crates to any clubs that are interested in the Longman electorate. We will then send them to remote communities around Queensland who are doing it tough. So, Johnno, thanks for the message, mate. Great things often come from a small spark.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  We are always so proud of our local Central Coast athletes when they compete for Australia at international events. Three athletes who have recently been chosen to represent Australia are Wilheim, Kaine and Tatem Hieber of Saratoga who will travel overseas to Venice, Italy to compete at the 13th World Junior Cadet and Under 21 Karate Championships in October of this year. The siblings all started training in karate at the age of four and have continued to develop their skills in the sport ever since. Their selection by the Australian Karate Federation to represent Australia is testament to their dedication, focus and athletic ability. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wilheim, who is 19 years old, has also been selected to represent Australia as part of the Australian senior team for which events will take place in Spain this November. As well as that, he is a student at the University of Technology Sydney, studying a bachelor of marine biology and environmental change. He juggles all these activities with a casual job on the Central Coast, which is a tremendous effort. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To all three siblings—to Wilheim, to Kaine and to Tatem—I commend you on your selection and wish you all the very best and success in the world at the upcoming championships. I very much look forward to following each of your sporting journeys overseas. A big good luck to all other Australian karate athletes who'll be competing at these championships as well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  It was an honour this week to host hundreds of Maronite community leaders, who came to Canberra at the behest of the Parliamentary Friends of Lebanon, which I was happy to host with my co-chair, the member for Parramatta. I want to thank the Speaker of the House Milton Dick for his generosity in inviting the Maronite community to come to Parliament House annually and host us for a reception. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was fantastic to have both the Foreign Minister and the shadow foreign minister in attendance to hear the concerns of the Australian Lebanese community and the Maronite leadership at the moment, particularly in relation to the ongoing situation with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Northern Lebanon and the implications that will have on many Australian connected family members who reside in Lebanon. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What strikes me about the Maronite community is that they have been fantastic migrants to Australia, integrated very well into our country, but maintain strong ties with Lebanon and their original home country. I call upon the government, as the opposition does, to make sure we have in place robust measures ahead of time given how many Australian connected people are in Lebanon at any one time and the deterioration of the situation in the region. I do call upon the government, as the opposition does, to make sure we have in place robust measures ahead of time, given how many people with connections to Australia are in Lebanon at any one time and the deterioration of the situation in the region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this was about the businesspeople, the politicians, the educators, the public servants, the diplomats, the ambassador and the faith leaders who were there yesterday to speak about their community issues. I want to thank in particular Bishop Tarabay for the spiritual leadership of the Maronite community. This is a fantastic community in Western Sydney and I welcome them to the House.</span>

Welcome to the other territory. I'm proud of these young Territorians and all the participants embarking on this learning journey.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  Gymea Bay Baths in my electorate should be revitalised. The Gymea Bay Baths, a place where many children in my electorate learn to swim, are usually unsuitable because of poor water quality, rubbish and fishing debris. Recently, they were heavily polluted by a storm which brought 10 tonnes of flood debris and 180 metres of netting. I recently visited these baths with our shadow minister, Jonno Duniam. Jonno, like me, is committed to seeing these baths restored to their former glory. The state of these facilities is just not good enough, and residents have had to put up with filthy water and rubbish in what used to be a picturesque and beautiful swimming hole. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But local organisations have been leading the charge. Baycare Gymea Bay demonstrates what is great about my local community. Locals founded Baycare in 2023. They don't sit around and wait for government. Twice a week, you can see these families with kids as young as seven cleaning up, picking up rubbish and putting it in bins. I'm committed to fighting for Gymea Bay Baycare to get funding to restore these baths to their former glory. I commend these local organisations, local families and local community groups for stepping up. It's time for us to give them support. I'll be fighting for them to get funding to restore Gymea Bay Baths.</span>

I fell just short of making my sixth Olympic Games this year, but I brought some medals to parliament for those opposite to recognise their performances over the last few sitting weeks.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first gold medal is for diving. I award that to the Leader of the Opposition for diving for cover when he gets asked to explain his nuclear costings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we go on to the well-done Angus, the member for Hume, who gets the gold medal for running. He's running away from his responsibility to propose even a single cost-of-living policy. It's a marathon effort from him!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the member for Farrer. She gets a gold medal for the best backflips on tax cuts. First, she won't support them, then she will support them and then she wants to have an election on them. Simone Biles would have some stiff competition here!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there is a new gold medal for the member for Fairfax in the brand new sport of sheer audacity. He gets the gold medal for conveniently forgetting that his party forgot to vote against energy bill relief.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well done to those members opposite! I was looking forward to hosting a medal presentation in the Hunter for you, but every time you sneak in you just want to talk to your faithful and never let me know you're in the Hunter. If you guys want to come and get your medals today, come on over at question time and we'll pass them over.</span>

While addressing some 600 people, the Prime Minister referred to a meal he recently shared with the Indonesian President-elect. He said: 'We had dinner, beautiful Australian beef—not the live export. We made sure it was dead.' Indonesia is itself an importer of live exports, making this joke an insult in itself. The PM should also be apologising for the mental health anguish and the financial and emotional trauma he is causing people in the industry, not cracking bad jokes like we just heard from over on the other side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only is the government showing utter disregard for the industry; they're also treating vital trade nations recklessly and failing to acknowledge the impact on our international trading relations. Kuwait, Israel, Jordan, UAE, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are just some of the markets who import live exports from us for religious and cultural reasons. We are effectively telling them that what they do is not okay. We are a world leader in animal welfare with live exports. We are proud and we should be proud about what our farmers do and how they've reformed and gotten better at what they do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is wont to use the cliched slogan 'No-one left behind, no-one held back'. Well, Prime Minister, the live exporters are feeling left behind and they are feeling held back by your bad policies and bad jokes.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  They say a week is a long time in politics, and, boy oh boy, hasn't it been a long week for the Liberals in New South Wales? 'Twas a mild, mid-winter Wednesday when we learnt that the Liberals failed to nominate over 140 candidates for council elections on 14 September—what a shocker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then the blame game began. The party president blamed the state director, who, of course, blamed him back. The state director was sacked, and now the New South Wales Liberals leader's job is under a cloud. To be honest, they all should go because in any normal job they would have all been punted by now, but, in a Liberal Party stacked with failed middle managers and washed-up consultants, we see those at fault still very much in charge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, in a moment of post-truth, their grand plan was to take the New South Wales Electoral Commission to court—a plan so cunning that it fell over days later. What's been most perplexing is that some have been surprised by this saga. What short memories they have. Incompetence is in the modern Liberals' DNA. They are the party of robodebt and secret ministries, and they didn't order enough vaccines. They had sports rorts and wasted $5 billion on new submarines without getting as much as a paddleboard. Now they want to build nuclear power plants across Australia. Don't do it, guys. If you can't fill out forms, you can't run the country. The Liberals are a shambles, and New South Wales knows it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  I'd like to offer my condolences to the Pankhurst family. We have very few World War II veterans left, and Alister Pankhurst from my area was one of them. Alister Pankhurst found out that he'd been called up for service and rode his pushbike in from picking spuds in Guyra back down to Armidale, to join the defence of Australia in New Guinea. Alister fought through Bougainville and at times, in his time in the mud, had to spend the night as part of the 2/11th Field Regiment firing from the perimeter, into the dark, because he knew the enemy was there but couldn't quite focus on where they were. It was a mighty fight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the most important thing about Alister's life was that he came home to his beloved Vera, who he married, and had five kids. Alister came from Guyra and died in Armidale, so his love of New England was quite evident. The question we have to ask ourselves is: would we do what Alister did? Would we give up everything to defend our nation? I believe we would. The biggest thing about Alister's life is that when he came back he didn't ask to be feted. He just went back to work on the railways and did his job. He did his job all the way through as a humble man. I had the great pleasure of meeting Alister. I hope he's with his maker. All the best, and lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:59</span>):  It's been over 60 days since the Leader of the Opposition made his big announcement with little detail. He, of course, made his announcement about nuclear reactors in this country. There is a big question that the Leader of the Opposition hasn't yet answered, and that is how much these nuclear reactors would cost. I thought, 'Don't take the Labor Party's word for it; let's go through what some other commentators have said about what nuclear energy might cost.' And this person said, 'It is enormously expensive—a very, very big cost.' Who was that? That was former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull! I know that Malcolm is not in the inner sanctum anymore with those guys. So, I thought, 'Let's go inside the tent; let's bring it in closer.' Someone else said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have one very, very simple goal, which is, to get prices down in the short to medium term. … Nuclear's not going to help me in that process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who could that be? That was the shadow Treasurer in 2018! Those were his words, not mine. I know there is a bit of mistrust between the Liberals and the Nationals. I know that the Liberals and Nationals don't always get along, so I thought, 'Let's dig a bit deeper and let's find another quote.' This learned person said this, 'Nuclear is ruled out by reason of cost.' Who would say that? The member for New England! In 2017, that's what he said. Don't take my word for it. It's too expensive. Just ask those opposite.</span>

We talked about one of the major reasons why we changed the tax cuts. It was to deliver for Australian women and Australian workers more broadly. We also spoke to the early childhood educators in her community about our best efforts to get them the decent pay they need and deserve to do their really important work. In the short time that the member for Dunkley has been here, we've made substantial progress on the issues that we discussed that day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a really big day for Australian parents, and especially for the mums of Middle Australia. Today, the government introduced legislation to pay superannuation on paid parental leave. And I want to pay tribute to Minister Rishworth, Minister Jones, Minister Gallagher, the Prime Minister, the cabinet and the caucus for making sure that we deliver on this commitment to Australian working parents to pay superannuation on paid parental leave. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This policy has been a priority of ours for some time and we are really proud to be taking the necessary steps to deliver it. It's a really important part of our efforts to ensure that Australian women earn more and keep more of what they earn and also retire with more, as well. Paying super on PPL will provide a more secure retirement for around 180,000 families each year. Unlike Senator Rennick and some of his colleagues on the other side, we support women's workforce participation and more secure well-paid jobs for women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are making good progress. Most of the almost one million jobs that have been created under this Prime Minister have been jobs filled by women. Women's workforce participation is now at a record high of 63.2 per cent. We are delivering really important pay rises in parts of our economy where the workforce is dominated by women, such as early childhood, aged care and the like. As I said a moment ago, one of the main motivations for delivering a tax cut for every taxpayer in the way that we are doing it is to make sure that Australian working women get a fairer ago, as well. Because of that, combined with the wages growth that we've seen, the average take-home pay for women working full time is more than $68 a week higher than it would have been under the wage growth of those opposite and the tax cuts of those opposite. We have spent this week working for and delivering for Middle Australia. We've been focused on the main game while they have been focused on political games. It's all about Australian workers earning more and keeping more of what they earn—and, because of our efforts, retiring with more as well.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:07</span>):  This morning I was contacted by a mother whose son is on the NDIS. I have her permission to read excerpts of her letter. It explains why this legislation should pass. It reads: 'Hi Mr Shorten. I woke up this morning to an article in the newspaper reporting that you've won sufficient support for your proposed changes to the NDIS. I then went to find my 15-year-old son in the kitchen, where he was tearing the place up. It was 4.45 am. He has a diagnosis of level 3 autism and a moderate intellectual disability. He is non-verbal and incontinent, has severe sensory dysfunction and is a beautiful but huge six-foot, 100-kilogram boy. His behaviours are exhausting. They're difficult. At times, they're scary. He will punch, pinch or bite without notice. He defecates on the floor every day, and he smears and eats it. He can do very little for himself and depends on home care from me, my husband and our carers. He's been an NDIS participant for 10 years. We can't survive without care for him but feel unsupported and completely price-gouged and exploited. I wish you every success in your changes to the NDIS. Please help us families who really need support. We're so sick of hearing about funding being used for holidays, lawn mowing and so on when we can hardly survive, maybe because we're so busy and burnt out we can't make as much noise.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can promise this amazing mum and her son hope in the new legislation. The first step is the new planning process. It'll be strength based needs assessment. It'll identify her son's strengths, goals, preferences and challenges. The assessment will be done by an accredited assessor who will meet with the family. The assessor will use various tools co-designed with people with disability, and it will respect her son's dignity and rights. The second step is an assessment report—a summary and assessment of the findings and recommendations for the types of supports needed—prepared by the assessor, who'll work with the family. It will be a clear, accurate, evidence based report reflecting her son's strengths, needs and preferences. The third step will be a flexible budget and stated supports—a funding package determined for her son on his report and NDIS rules. A flexible budget gives the money to spend on NDIS supports as participants choose, as long as they're reasonable and necessary. The fourth step will be to choose supports that he wants with this flexible budget—a chance for the son and the mother to plan and buy the supports that suit his needs and preferences by working with a dedicated navigator. The bill will ensure clarity as to what you can and can't spend your funding on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill—hopefully, passed in the next two hours here—will give her son more choice and control over supports to improve his quality of life. The new system will be co-designed with people with disability and their families. It will be based on the steps of assessment, report, budget and choosing supports. The new system will be personalised, transparent and consistent. It will respect her son's dignity, rights and aspirations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the thousands of people who've contributed to the development of this legislation. This afternoon, this parliament will help all Australians and their families with disability.</span>

Just last week the government appointed a former Labor premier to the board of Australia Post. She replaces someone who was a former director of the Liberal Party, appointed—unsurprisingly—by the previous coalition government. In February 2023, this government commissioned a review of public sector board appointments to respond to transparency concerns. The report of that review was given to the government in August 2023. Treasurer, 12 months on, why has the report not been released publicly, and when will it be released?</span>

Today in the gallery we have, as guests of the member for Durack, students from the mighty electorate of Durack, from the Geraldton Grammar School. Former New South Wales member for Monaro Nichole Overall is joining us today. I'm also pleased to inform the House that present in the gallery today is Mr Allan Pidgeon AM, Chair of the national Australian Flag Association, a voluntary community organisation formed to increase appreciation of the history and significance of our national flag. Mr Pidgeon is in Canberra today as part of the celebration of Australian National Flag Day, which will be held on 3 September. Welcome to you all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:15</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for her question and for her tireless work for families in the electorate of Werriwa. Today is an important day for Australian families. This morning I introduced legislation into the parliament to pay superannuation on government paid parental leave. This reform is good for families, good for women and good for the economy, and we are proud to be legislating it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through paid parental leave the government supports parents to take a step back from paid work, and through this bill we are taking action to not only provide critical financial support when a new baby arrives but also boost retirement savings. With this measure, from July 2025 around 180,000 families each year who receive government paid parental leave will have a superannuation contribution of 12 per cent paid directly into their super account. This is the third tranche of our government's historic reform to paid parental leave, an investment totalling $2.3 billion, which has given families more access, has made it more flexible, has made it easier to share care and is more generous, with the expansion to six months by 2026.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I've been asked what the response to this morning's legislation has been. Earlier today I had the opportunity, along with the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance, to meet Canberra mum Aisling and her kids, Leo and Josie. Aisling told me, 'I come from an early childhood background and know the importance of that extra time with children and that extra super that is now going to be there.' We've seen many groups welcome this announcement and the introduction of this important bill. The Business Council of Australia called it 'the right thing to do for both women and the economy'. The ACTU called it 'a historic step in achieving gender equality in retirement'. Georgie Dent from the Parenthood said, 'Paying super on paid parental leave would be a game changer for families across Australia, with a significant win for gender equality.' The Super Members Council have also welcomed our bill, saying, 'This historical reform will make a vast difference to the lives and retirement incomes of generations of Australian women.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we announced our commitment to paid super on paid parental leave, the opposition provided lukewarm support, and I urge them to get behind this legislation in the Senate and get this done. We know that investing in paid parental leave is an investment in Australian families, in women's economic security and in the broader economy. I look forward to seeing this come to fruition.</span>

That includes 14 of these hubs for the first time in the outer suburbs of our big cities, where the percentage of people with a university degree is low, and 20 more in the regions and in the bush. Yesterday, I announced that applications are open for a further 10 regional university study hubs. Again, it's not the only thing we're doing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Universities aren't just places where people study or where they work; they're also places where people live. We need to ensure that they are safe. One in 20 students have been sexually assaulted since they started university and one in six have been sexually harassed. One in two have felt like they weren't heard when they made a complaint. This is what one student told the STOP Campaign: 'I'm sick of my friends being assaulted, I'm sick of begging to feel safe, and I'm sick of feeling ignored.' The awful truth is that not enough has been done to address sexual violence in our universities, and for too long, students haven't been heard. That is now changing.</span>

Next month, when parliament returns, I will introduce legislation to make that a reality.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is committed to tackling gender based violence. Digitally created and altered sexually explicit material shared without consent is a damaging and deeply distressing form of abuse, and we know that this abuse overwhelmingly targets women and girls. It inflicts deep, long-lasting harm on victims, it perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes and it contributes to gender based violence. The Albanese government has no tolerance for this insidious criminal behaviour, and yesterday the parliament passed our bill that creates new criminal offences that ban the sharing of nonconsensual, sexually explicit deepfake material online. The new criminal offences make clear that those who share sexually explicit material without consent using technology like artificial intelligence will face very serious criminal penalties, and these penalties will assist in protecting vulnerable people from serious online harm and deter and punish this abusive and damaging behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, also in relation to combating family and gender based violence in the family law system, I have introduced legislation into this House to make the family law system simpler, safer and fairer for all Australian families. Shockingly, family and domestic violence is present in approximately 80 per cent of parenting matters in the family courts. The proposed reforms will make it clear that the economic impact of family violence is a relevant consideration in family property matters. Victims of family violence should not be financially disadvantaged when they leave a violent relationship. It's quite a long and detailed bill, but, among other things, the new laws will treat pets as a special form of property to ensure that pets are not used and abused in cycles of family violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms will build on the Albanese government's landmark reforms that came into effect in May this year, which put the best interests of children at the centre of decision-making in the family court and established new information-sharing arrangements to protect against family safety risks. Given the significant and continuing harm caused by family and domestic violence, I look forward to the full support of this parliament for these reforms. The Albanese government is delivering on its commitment to end violence against women, to tackle the scourge of online harm and to keep Australians safe.</span>

Speaker Smith had examples of ruling questions out of order on 15 February 2021 and 4 December 2018. In those questions—one was to the then Prime Minister and one was to the then Assistant Treasurer—those sorts of characterisations or comments during the questions were ruled out. Speaker Smith on page 12,434 of <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, particularly with this issue, said:</span>

They began from the moment at which our Olympians came home and the Leader of the Opposition did an interview on Sky News in which he declared that no-one should be allowed in from Gaza, even though the fact is that the border from Gaza had been closed for months and there had been no response and no issues raised by those opposite while people were actually coming in. They waited till people weren't coming in and the border was closed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there the Leader of the Opposition was, at the moment of the Olympians coming home, which should have been a moment of national unity. He chose division once again. The Australian scarf stayed on, but the mask of this divisive Leader of the Opposition came off, and he's still going. On Monday he asked about terrorist visas; on Tuesday, after being called out for being so angry and for not focusing on the cost of living, he moved that the Treasurer be no longer heard; and yesterday he gagged himself by not asking a single question in question time but having others ask questions which were fed up to them, including questions like the ones today which seemed to suggest somehow that I'm responsible for who's in Qatar. I'll tell you who's in Qatar who I wouldn't allow in Qatar: that's the Hamas leadership. I would not allow them in Australia That is what I would do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:35</span>):  I thank the member for Newcastle for the question, but I also particularly want to mention her advocacy for women, which is in a large part responsible for many of the measures that this government is putting in place. She and the women on the Status of Women Committee on this side of the House have been extraordinary advocates for women for their entire careers, and I thank them for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is strongly committed to women's equality. It's a goal that every single one of us around the cabinet table have. It's not the responsibility of just one minister; it is the responsibility of every cabinet minister. This week, we have, of course, continued to make significant progress. Yesterday, as we've heard, the parliament passed laws criminalising the creation and distribution of non-consensual deepfake pornography. It is an issue that overwhelmingly affects women and girls and will now carry criminal penalties, including the possibility of jail for up to seven years. That is a very good thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this week, the Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence reaffirmed our commitment to ending gender based violence in her powerful statement in this place. The assistant minister and the Minister for Social Services are doing an incredible job leading the work on the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children, as is the Minister for Social Services in introducing our legislation to provide greater support to Australian families, particularly women, by paying superannuation on government paid parental leave, benefiting over 180,000 people per year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that is working hard to make women's lives better, fairer and more equal, particularly through shifting the gender pay gap. Data released from the ABS just last week shows that the national gender pay gap is at 11.5 per cent. This is a record low, and it compares to a gender pay gap of 14.1 per cent in May 2022, when we came to government. Under this government, women's average weekly earnings have increased by $173.80 since May 2022. That's a 10.8 per cent increase. And we've reached an all-time high for women's workforce participation, which is now at 63.2 per cent. We are taking action to close that pay gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a parliament, we should be setting an example for the treatment of women in this workplace and communities across the country, which is why we're working to implement the recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Set the standard</span> report. This week, the government introduced legislation to the House to establish the Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission. I thank members from across the chamber who have engaged in good faith on this bill, which will enforce behaviour codes for parliamentarians and staff in Commonwealth parliamentary workforces. This is another important reform that supports the safety and wellbeing of women in this place and demonstrates that the government is leading by example and is committed to women's safety.</span>

A mum from Curtin told me that yesterday her 15-year-old son said that he's decided to take up sports gambling as a side hustle because it's easy money. Our committee inquiry contained 31 recommendations to reduce harm from predatory online gambling companies. Fourteen months later, only one recommendation—banning ads—is even being discussed. Will the government respond to the other 30 recommendations before the next election?</span>

They are concerned about the impact that a whole range of media can have, whether it's gambling advertising or whether it's the sort of media that sometimes pops up on people's mobile phones. There are a range of issues with social media causing a great deal of concern about the harm that can be caused.</span>

I thank the member for Curtin and others for the way that they have engaged in this process.</span>

The first duty of any Commonwealth government is to keep Australians safe and protect our interests. That's why this morning I was proud to announce that the Albanese Labor government will invest $850 million to manufacture advanced long-range strike missiles in Australia. In partnership with Kongsberg Defence Australia, we are investing in a factory at Newcastle airport to manufacture naval strike missiles and joint strike missiles. This will create 500 jobs in construction and 100 ongoing high-skilled, high-tech jobs. This will be only the second factory in the world to produce these advanced strike missiles and the first outside of Norway. Australian industry is highly skilled and cost competitive and we will actually receive these Australian-made missiles faster than if we joined the global queue. This is all about keeping Australians safe in an uncertain global environment, creating local jobs and supporting a future made in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is in stark contrast to the approach when the Leader of the Opposition was the defence minister. While the Leader of the Opposition was sitting on the NSC and Minister for Defence, Australia experienced a wasted decade. It was all <span style="font-style:italic;">Top Gun</span> music and red carpet and zero delivery. Under him, the guided weapons enterprise produced two media releases—that's it. Under us, we are building two missile factories. Under him, Navy's maximum weapon range was about 200 kilometres, using 1970s technology. Under us, it will be 2,500 kilometres. Under him, two Australian shipyards closed and over 2,000 workers lost their jobs. Under us, there will be continuous shipbuilding in South Australia and Western Australia, providing decades of work. He wanted submarines built overseas. We're building submarines here, creating 20,000 jobs.</span>

I believe that Australians, when they look at what is happening in that part of the world and are horrified, particularly for people of Jewish background, dissent or faith, people of Islamic background or faith or people with relatives in that region, want to see this happen. What they don't want is conflict brought here. They want Australia to play a constructive role in the region. They object to some of the misinformation which is out there about Australia's role in that conflict. We are not participants, but we are people who are, consistent with the role Australia has historically played, advocates for peace, security, humanitarian values and the protection of all innocent life, whether it be Israeli or Palestinian.</span>

She wants, like we all do on this side of the House, for Australia to be a place that makes things like Australian steel. We've got a proud heritage in steelmaking. The strength and quality of Aussie steel has supported sectors across the economy. It's sustained communities from the Illawarra to the Hunter to Central Queensland to Whyalla through to the outer suburbs of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. It delivers so many secure, well-paying jobs, and this has got to continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that the world is changing, and we've got to prepare for it. We've got to find new ways to sustainably make steel. Demand for green steel is expected to almost double by 2050. Demand for green aluminium is expected to double by 2030. Other countries know this, and they're making significant investments to decarbonise. We cannot be left behind. As part of our Future Made in Australia plan, the Albanese government has started work on charting a course for the future of Australian green steel and metals manufacturing. Today we took another step down that path, bringing together an expert panel to advise the government on what's needed to shape a sustainable metals future. Industry, unions and research partners are working with government to plan a bright future for Australian metals. As BlueScope CEO Tania Archibald notes, 'For Australia to capitalise on the opportunity, ambitious, forward-thinking policy will be required with industry working in partnership with government.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm asked about different approaches, and, boy, we've heard some! The only thing that the Liberal and National Parties do faster than claim they support manufacturing is to walk away from that very claim. It has been particularly staggering to see Queensland Liberal and National Party MPs so willingly dud manufacturing workers from their great state. The member for Flynn described our $45 million investment into electrolyser manufacturing in Gladstone—in his electorate—as 'economic insanity'. The member for Herbert said manufacturing in Townsville 'isn't viable' and described supporting manufacturing jobs as 'reckless'. The member for Wide Bay, not to be outdone, said he totally disagrees with the premise of creating manufacturing jobs in Maryborough and Hervey Bay. It's 'no' to making things here and 'yes' to importing everything. That's that side. There's no putting Queensland workers on the job making the metals, processing minerals or building batteries and solar panels. After question time, they'll all fly home, put on their high-vis vests and act like they're the best friend regional workers ever had. But Queensland workers need to know that here in Canberra the LNP MPs were not there for them and their future. It is a disgrace.</span>

Certainly, one of our discussions has been about the challenges in accessing good quality, affordable health care the further away you get from our nation's GPOs. It's not just an issue in rural and regional Australia; increasingly, this is a challenge in some of our outer-suburban and peri-urban areas, and it's one we are very focused on.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could say a few things about ways in which we're seeking to address that. First of all, as I think the member for Mayo and I have discussed, we are right near the end stage of the review we're currently undertaking about the distribution rules to ensure that all areas have access to doctors and other health professionals as well. That has been a review in which the National Rural Health Alliance and a range of other rural health groups—ACRRM, the rural doctors' college, and many others besides—have participated in very fully. From our first budget in October 2022, we increased the incentives that are available for doctors to go and practice in rural and regional Australia. We lifted those incentives in dollar terms, and we expanded them in terms of the skills that doctors might be able to take to rural and regional Australia with a particular emphasis on ensuring that skills around emergency medicine—</span>

Perhaps if the leader of the Nationals was a bit interested, he would ask a question about it. But I come back to the question from the member for Mayo. I'd make this point as well. As the member for Mayo knows, we tripled the bulk-billing incentive for visits to the doctor, because I know that bulk-billing rates have been declining more sharply in rural and regional Australia than in urban Australia. I'm very pleased to say that the biggest increases to bulk-billing for GP visits in the eight months that that incentive has been operating have been in rural and regional Australia. I am not sure of the latest data, but the member for Mayo's electorate has seen either the biggest or the second-biggest increase in GP bulk-billing rates of any electorate in this parliament over the last eight months. What that does for a standard consult in rural and regional Australia is lift the income for those doctors by 50 per cent. We know there is more to do, but I appreciate at least the member for Mayo— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:55</span>):  I thank the member for Hawke for his question. I particularly enjoyed visiting an early learning centre, Yaluk Burron, in the member for Hawke's electorate, as well as meeting some early childhood educators who were going to be part of our early childhood education workforce as they were studying certificate III. The member for Hawke, like all on this side of the House, knows just how important the role of early childhood educators is—how important it is for setting up our children to thrive, how important it is for our economy and how important it is for families. I am proud to be part of a Labor government that recognises that value and the importance of that work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the recognition that we have for early childhood education and care and for early childhood educators and teachers, I am proud that we are delivering a 15 per cent historic wage increase for early childhood workers right across the country. That means that 200,000 early childhood workers right across Australia will have in their pay packets at least $100 more a week by the end of this year. By the end of next year, that means at least another $150 back in their pay packets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with the member for Hawke and members from right across this side as I have travelled around visiting early childhood education centres, educators and parents, I have heard a lot from educators over the past few weeks about what this $3.6 billion investment means to them. It means that they will have a liveable wage. As Courtney, who is a passionate early childhood educator from Tasmania, said: 'This wage increase will have a huge impact. It will help me to afford my bills comfortably, have a social life and help my mindset when dealing with the challenges that we deal with every day at work.' I think that says it all about what a difference this 15 per cent wage increase is going to make to early childhood educators and workers across Australia. It's not just about giving them the wage that they deserve; it really is about ensuring that we have a strong and stable workforce, the kind of workforce that we need for the transformations that we want to undertake in early childhood education and care to achieve the vision that we have for a universal system that is affordable, accessible and inclusive. We can't do that if we don't have a strong and stable workforce. It is what the children of Australia deserve, it is what the families of Australia deserve and it is what an Albanese Labor government will deliver.</span>

On 7 October, Hamas terrorists went into small Israeli farming villages and a music festival, where they filmed themselves gleefully murdering children, raping women and mutilating their victims, including after death. Thirteen hundred innocent people were gunned down and murdered for sport and 251 hostages were forced at gunpoint into Hamas terror tunnels under Gaza. On return, thousands of people were dancing in the street in celebration. Does supporting Hamas pass the character test for an Australian visa?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that I've said to people here who have been in any way equivocal—unlike the government, which has been unequivocal, as has the opposition in their condemnation of what happened on October 7—is that the people who were there at the Nova music festival looked like a whole lot of people who would attend a Splendour in the Grass concert or who would attend the sorts of events that happen here in Australia, where young people celebrate their common humanity, where they engage in fun and where they also tend to be people who are open to ideas and open to collaboration with people across different faiths. One of the things that some of the Jewish community leaders have said to me in the wake of October 7 is that they are precisely the sorts of people who want to see peace and reconciliation with the Palestinians as well. There they were, very close to where the border was. To have them subjected to the horrific murder, rape, abuse and kidnapping of people that occurred is horrific. It would be horrific if it occurred to any human being. But, of course, one of the reasons why the world came together in the wake of World War II and in the wake of the Holocaust was to—</span>

Because, when the people of this country are under pressure and when the cost of living is the No. 1 pressure that people are feeling, those opposite couldn't care less, and we know that because they haven't asked any questions this week on the cost of living, inflation or the economy more broadly. It's after three o'clock on the Thursday of a sitting week, and there's total silence from those opposite on the No. 1 issue that this country and its people confront. Those opposite might not care about the cost of living, but this side of the parliament does. That's why we're rolling out cost-of-living relief, with a tax cut for every taxpayer, energy bill relief for every household, cheaper medicines, cheaper early childhood education, rent assistance and getting wages moving again after a decade of wage stagnation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, there is no shortage of challenges in our economy. In the global economy and the domestic economy, inflation is No. 1 when it comes to the main challenges in our economy, and we are focused on the main game. In the past couple of years, we've seen inflation come off substantially. We've seen almost a million jobs created. We've seen real wages growing again. We've got a tax cut rolling out for every taxpayer at the same time as we have turned two big Liberal deficits into two big Labor surpluses. But we know, despite all the progress that we have made, that people are still under the pump and people are still under pressure.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why it beggars belief, when this is the main game right around Australia, that those opposite can't manage to ask even a single question about the cost-of-living pressures that people are confronting—not one idea about fighting inflation, not one policy for the cost of living, absolutely nothing about their $315 billion in secret cuts and what that means for Medicare and pensions and for our economy more broadly. This should be a disqualifying week for those opposite. When people are under pressure, they could not care less about the cost of living.</span>

Everyone who applies for an Australian visa is subject to the same security standard set by the same agencies and the same personnel as under the former government. Our intelligence agencies make those decisions. Our intelligence agencies have the confidence of this side of the House, and so does Mike Burgess, who has made it very clear that if you have violent extremism as an ideology then you certainly have a problem with an ASIO assessment. ASIO make these national security assessments. They're not made on a partisan basis or a political basis. ASIO do this work and they do it as well on an ongoing basis, which is relevant to previous questions that have been asked over the last couple of weeks.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're working to deliver $3 billion in HECS relief and a fairer higher education system. We're bringing together two great Labor economic reforms by adding superannuation to paid parental leave. We're dealing with advances so that we can take action to remove the scourge of domestic violence in a generation. This is what matters to Australians, this is what makes a difference to people's lives and this is what my government is focused on.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We stand together and we look ahead together, because what our great history has shown us, time and time again, is that Australia is always best when we come together, when we seek to unite rather than seek to divide and when we try to work with people rather than target individuals in a cynical exercise aimed at targeting a whole group of Australians.</span>

                  </span>I have been asked a lot about numbers in the past week, so here are some numbers I'm focused on: 13.6 million, the number of Australians who got a tax cut on 1 July; 2.6 million, the number of award wage earners who got a pay rise; three million, the number of additional bulk-billed GP appointments; 10 million, the number of households getting dollars off their power bills; one million, the number of families benefiting from cheaper child care; 650,000, the number of visits to our Medicare urgent care clinics; half a million, the number of fee-free TAFE enrolments; 70,000, the number of new manufacturing jobs; and over one million, the number of households benefiting from increases in rent assistance. That's what we've been focused on. Those opposite have forgotten their job. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  On 20 August, I asked the Treasurer, 'Is the federal government going to back the Olympics and their pagan ritual opening ceremony, whose major purpose seemed to be to mock and denigrate Christianity?' Clearly the question was about backing an organisation that was going to spend $60 billion—and I must apologise to the House for misleading the House myself because I said $30,000 million, and it's obvious now that it's $60,000 million. So I apologise to the House for that. Clearly the question was about that.</span>

                  <a href="00AKI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  The Prime Minister's moment of truth has just been before us. He failed that moment of truth; there's no question about that. He was asked a question about whether or not it was the policy of his government to be sympathetic to people who had an allegiance or had a sympathy to the Hamas terrorist organisation. Hamas has been listed as a terrorist organisation by our country. Today the Prime Minister, yet again, did what he's done in previous questions and answers in this place—that is, he tried to hide behind public servants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If it is the policy of the Australian government that somebody with a sympathy for the Hamas terrorist organisation or another terrorist organisation is eligible to be granted a visa in this country, that is a radical departure from the policies of any previous Labor or Liberal government, yet today the Prime Minister tried to hide behind ASIO yet again. He tried to suggest that this would be a decision of ASIO—what, that somebody had a sympathy for a listed terrorist organisation who had just committed acts of atrocity in Israel only a matter of months ago?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Think about that proposition and what the Australian Prime Minister is saying here—what message he is delivering to the Australian public and to the world. He is saying that for his government, a democratically elected government that has continued listing Hamas as a terrorist organisation, a sympathy for the barbaric acts of Hamas doesn't preclude somebody from being granted a visa to come into this country. That is quite astounding. Are people who have sympathy for a far-right organisation involved in a Neo-Nazi movement or are affiliated with or have sympathies for al-Qaeda, ISIL or ISIS now eligible for a visa to come into our country—a tourist visa, no less? It's without precedent that a government in our country would allow people from a war zone governed by Hamas, a listed terrorist organisation, into our country—even under the refugee and humanitarian program, in the current circumstances, let alone on a tourist visa without the proper checks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When people apply for the refugee and humanitarian program, they come here with proper checks. That's the reality. When we brought people in from Syria, we looked at people individually. We didn't take people from Syria proper. People were located in Jordan. They were located in northern Iraq and elsewhere. We conducted biometrics checks. We checked them against databases to make sure people were who they said they were. We wanted to make sure that they hadn't been sympathisers with the terrorists at the time. We wanted to make sure that they weren't involved in the persecution of minorities or involved in acts of atrocity otherwise. It took a long period of time. In fact, the Labor Party criticised me at the time because, by the 12-month mark, we hadn't issued all of those 12,000 visas. If you look at what we did there in the uplift in Kabul, we provided safety and security as the paramount consideration for the government and, therefore, for the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Australian government and the Prime Minister have done now has departed from that previous conduct. The Prime Minister came in here and said, 'There's no difference between what you did and the way in which the Labor Party has brought in 1,300 people from Gazan territory on a tourist visa without the requisite checks.' That is completely and utterly untrue. The Prime Minister hasn't corrected the record. The Prime Minister came in here and quoted—I saw him read from the page he was holding—the director-general of ASIO. This is not some low-level public servant. This is the Director-General of Security for Australia. Mr Burgess is an accomplished public servant. He has sacrificed. He receives death threats, and he serves his country with great distinction. The Prime Minister of our country came in here and deliberately read from a piece of paper, and the quote that he delivered to this chamber—and, through this chamber, to the Australian public—was a misquote of what Mr Burgess had actually said. It wasn't any misquote. It wasn't that he skipped a sentence or that he just missed out on a couple of words. What it did show was that the Prime Minister was willing to misrepresent the Director-General of ASIO to suit the Prime Minister's own failings, because what the Prime Minister had done by coming into this parliament and saying earlier that the same process had applied to bringing 1,300 people in as it did to the Syrians, what he was suggesting was, and what he was express about, was that each of the 1,300 people who had been issued a tourist visa was subject to an ASIO assessment. But as we now know, that is not true either. So when the Prime Minister misquoted the Director-General of ASIO, the words he missed out quoting, the words that he decided not to read out quite deliberately, were words that would otherwise have shown the Prime Minister for the fraud that he is. That's what happened here. That's what happened.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Has the Prime Minister come to this dispatch box, as is the tradition and is this precedent in this chamber, to correct the record? No, he has not. He tabled a transcript which demonstrated the difference. He tabled a transcript which demonstrated that he had misquoted Mr Burgess. </span>

He promised the Australian people he would provide detail on the Voice—he deliberately made a decision not to provide detail. He said to the Australians in three budgets that he would have a plan to help them out economically. He has failed on each front. Interest rates have gone up on 12 occasions. Inflation is not contained in this country, and yet interest rates are coming down in the United Kingdom, are on the way down in the United States, and they've already come down in New Zealand and in Canada. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that this Prime Minister now has broken his golden promise at the election. His golden promise at the election was to keep Australia safe and what we now know is that the Prime Minister has made our country less safe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a welcoming country. When we brought the 12,000 people in from Syria, when we brought countless thousands of others in from around the world to be a part of our society—to be a wonderful part of our society—we did it in a structured way and we did it in a way where, when there were people in the queue who had a compelling story to put but who were not classified as anything other than a safety risk, we excluded those people from the line. We excluded those people from the line. We made the tough decisions that needed to be made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what this Prime Minister has done is he's made us less safe, and the motive is obvious to all. The motive is for domestic political gain. That's what the Prime Minister has done here and that's what he's been called out on. The Prime Minister decided to bring people in—as we now know because the Minister for Industry and Science pointed out on the weekend—on a tourist visa because we get people here more quickly, not a humanitarian visa where there are greater checks. This Prime Minister has sold the Australian public out and for that he should be condemned.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  How pathetic. Who moves an MPI about the economy and then gets to the ninth minute of his speech and realises he hasn't mentioned it yet? He read out a couple of little token dot points before he got back to his main business of trying to divide this community. At a time when we've got no shortage of economic and social challenges, his main game and his main priority is to try and set Australians against Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Wednesday I experienced a profound moment of solidarity with the member for Hume, the shadow Treasurer, and that was when the Leader of the Opposition tried to stop me talking about the economy. This is a very familiar experience for the shadow Treasurer. The member for Hume and I don't have a lot in common, but we do have that in common. The Leader of the Opposition wants neither of us talking about the economy. That's why he relegates the shadow Treasurer to this humiliating silence day after day. It's why we still didn't get any questions whatsoever in this entire week from those opposite on the cost of living, inflation, employment, wages or closing the gender pay gap. There's been absolutely nothing on the economy all week. Doesn't that speak volumes about the approach that is being taken by those opposite?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want the House and the people who are watching and listening outside the House to understand that this week on this Labor side of the parliament, under Prime Minister Albanese and our team, we've advanced our agenda on paying super on paid parental leave. We've advanced our agenda on making multinational companies pay their fair share of tax. We've made progress on the NDIS. We've approved the world's biggest solar precinct. We've advanced our efforts to cut HECS debt for millions of people. We've advanced our efforts when it comes to the net zero authority, and we've strengthened our ties with Indonesia. We've done all of those things while maintaining a primary focus on the cost of living and rolling out substantial and meaningful cost-of-living help in the most responsible way. That's how we've spent our week, and that's how we've spent the last few days of question time. We've focused on the cost of living because that is the No. 1 thing that people are confronting in the communities that we represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because these colleagues are in touch with their local communities, they know that our highest priority is and must be rolling out a tax cut for every taxpayer and energy bill relief for every household, making medicines cheaper, helping with rent, making early childhood education cheaper, paying educators fairly for the important work that they do, getting wages moving again and closing the gender pay gap. These are our priorities, and we have made progress this week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when the cost of living is the No. 1 issue in our communities, those opposite couldn't care less. That's not just something I say; it's something we know from the fact that on Thursday afternoon, at the end of a long sitting week, not once did they ask us about the cost of living or, indeed, anything about the economy. I've told the House how we have spent our week. The Leader of the Opposition has spent the whole week trying to divide the community, and that's because it's all he knows and all he does. His little dog whistle plays only one tune, and we heard it all week. As I said the other day, when the Leader of the Opposition plays his little dog whistle, the shadow Treasurer rolls over. We saw once again today that the shadow Treasurer is in the doghouse. The Prime Minister has Toto and the Leader for the Opposition has the member for Hume, but Toto has more to offer the economic debate in this country than the shadow Treasurer does.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. The point I'm making is that we will start to take the shadow Treasurer seriously when his own colleagues do and give him a question, and there is absolutely no sign of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know why there's been a sole focus from those opposite on trying to divide our community and diminish our country. It's because they're trying to distract from the fact that we are in the third year of a parliamentary term and we still haven't heard one costed or credible policy on the economy or the cost of living from those opposite. This is quite an extraordinary thing: the third year of a three-year parliamentary term, and not one idea about fighting inflation, not one policy for the cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the thing people are starting to cotton onto, in terms of the silence of those opposite on the economy and their motives for that, is that the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for finance have both said there is $315 billion too much spending in our budget, and the logical conclusion from that is that they will cut $315 billion from the budget. So they need to come clean on what their $315 billion in secret cuts means for Medicare and what it means for pensions. One of the reasons for that spending is the indexation of the pension, which we wrongly assumed was a bipartisan position, that the pension is indexed to keep up with the cost of living. But we will assume that no more: they have said that indexing the pension or investing in Medicare or spending on the PBS is, in their words, 'wasteful spending'. So, let's have no more delays, when it comes to those opposite and their $315 billion in secret cuts. Let's hear where the axe will fall and let's hear what it means for Medicare and pensions and for the economy more broadly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that this whole confected, divisive outrage has been all about this week is that in their heart of hearts, if those opposite know that people are under pressure, they want more inflation. They want higher interest rates. They want higher unemployment. They want a more divided community. In the absence of any compelling or costed or credible policies, they think their best way to sneak back into office is through the back door. They think that if inflation is higher and interest rates are higher and people are under more pressure, those opposite will profit from that politically—and they should be ashamed of themselves for taking that view.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We take a completely different view. We don't pretend for one second that all the challenges in our economy have been solved. We acknowledge that people are still under pressure, but we know that inflation had a '6' in front of it when we came to office and it's got a '3' in front of it now. Under Prime Minister Albanese we've created almost a million jobs, and that's never happened before in a parliamentary term. We know that real wages are growing again. They were falling under those opposite. We know that nominal wages growth is almost double what we saw in their wasted decade of deliberate wage stagnation and wage suppression. We know that tax cuts are rolling out for every taxpayer. Those opposite wanted tax cuts for only some taxpayers; they wanted tax cuts only for people who were already doing relatively well in comparison to others. We also know that in a little over two years in office we have turned two enormous Liberal deficits into two big Labor surpluses, and the Reserve Bank governor has said that that is helping in the fight against inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, whether it's our responsible economic management, whether it's our cost-of-living relief—which is meaningful and substantial but designed in the most responsible way—whether it's our investments in the future, whether it's paying super on PPL or whether it's all the other things we've been working on this week, the contrast could not be clearer: a Labor side of this parliament who cares deeply about and understand the pressures on people and is responding with real and responsible policy, versus an opposition that could not care less about the pressures people are under. They are horrendously out of touch. They would rather start another culture war than finish the fight against inflation, and every question time this week has made that clear.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TEHAN:</span>
                  </a>  It was telling today that the last question of question time from our side that went to the Prime Minister was about a character test. Sadly, this week we have seen the Prime Minister's character put to test. He has been asked question after question after question on very serious national security issues, and he has failed to fully answer any of them. After three days of questioning, we got a partial answer to a figure which had already been reported on the Channel 7 news. We got that out of the Prime Minister, but that was it. The Australian people are feeling like they're being treated with contempt. They have no trust when it comes to national security of this government, and especially when it comes to immigration, because they have seen, time and time again, the government fail them. That is why they are looking at the Prime Minister and saying, 'Please, for once, give us a straight answer.' Time and time again, the Prime Minister continues to fail them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We even had the absurd status where the Prime Minister said he couldn't talk because it was similar to on-water matters. Yet as Channel 7 pointed out in their news report, this was something that the Prime Minister rallied against. He said, 'We cannot have that, we need to make sure the questions are answered in the parliament.' The new immigration minister, when these issues were raised, came into this place and said the parliament deserves answers, yet what have we heard this week? Nothing but a cone of silence. We have seen the Prime Minister duck and weave like an Australian batsman facing the West Indies fast-bowlers when they were at their best—duck and weave, duck and weave, duck and weave.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, we saw this on display, sadly, with the last two questions. I want to repeat these questions—they were asked by the member for Berowra. He asked them to the Prime Minister:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On 7 October, Hamas terrorists went into small Israeli farming villages and a music festival, where they filmed themselves gleefully murdering children, raping women and mutilating their victims, including after death. Thirteen hundred innocent people were [hunted] down and murdered for sport and 251 hostages were forced at gunpoint into Hamas … tunnels under Gaza. On return, thousands of people were dancing in the street in celebration. Does supporting Hamas pass the character test for an Australian visa?</span>

It happens parliament after parliament and year after year. For those playing at home who aren't aware: shocking as it might be to those who sat through the Leader of the Opposition's contribution and the member for Wannon's contribution, this debate, as it's listed in the papers of the parliament, is about Australia's economy. It is supposed to go to the challenges facing Australian households and people across our communities in regard to the cost of living. Fundamentally, that's what this debate is supposed to be about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the Treasurer speak entirely about the efforts that the Albanese Labor government has gone to, the policies that our government has implemented, and some of the successes that we've realised and those that we still aim to realise in regard to assisting and helping Australian households and people all across our community deal with the cost-of-living challenge and keeping our economy very, very strong. What we know absolutely, clearly and transparently is that the Liberal Party have no interest in speaking about the Australian economy. They have no interest in dealing with the cost-of-living challenge that this government—our government, the Labor government—has a relentless focus on addressing. In fact, all that the opposition leader and the Liberal Party want to talk about are foreign policy matters that are, in effect, a cloaking device for the dog whistle that we all saw coming.</span>

                  </a>  Indeed, Deputy Speaker. Thank you. I don't need to use any particular words, because the Australian people can see right through this pathetic and cynical approach that the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party are so desperate to pursue, because ultimately they know that, when the Labor government are delivering for the Australian people, working tirelessly to address these cost-of-living challenges and, indeed, maintaining a strong and robust economy now and into the future, their political fortunes are entirely tied to their ability to drive fear and division in our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about the matter that this debate is supposed to focus on: the Australian economy, keeping the Australian economy strong and robust, and ensuring that it delivers for working people all across our nation. We inherited an economy that the Liberal Party had trashed. They had inflation running above six per cent. They had racked up a trillion dollars of Liberal debt, and they had nothing to show for it; it hadn't been invested wisely in order to continue to serve the community and build the economic structures that were required for the future. They had racked up a trillion dollars of Liberal debt, ploughing it into niche, partisan political pursuits that in no way benefited either the taxpayers or the broader Australian community. Of course, what we know is that that mismanagement on their part began the process of interest rates rises that we then saw.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has more than halved that inflation rate, and we have done what the Liberal Party could not do in their decade of government: we have delivered not just one but two budget surpluses that are contributing to the disinflationary environment that the Reserve Bank governor has explicitly referred to. The Australian economy is in a very strong and robust position. Households have been doing it tough, but there is light at the end of the tunnel, and our government will continue to prosecute households' interests relentlessly. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  I reject the comments from the member for Hawke and also his imputations about the coalition. I want to look at the sad story of this government's record when it comes to failing to keep Australians safe and failing dismally to manage the economy, the two things that right now actually matter most to Australians, who are in a cost-of-living crisis and are worried about their personal safety and their family needs. Those opposite should perhaps open their uni textbooks and look up Maslow's hierarchy of needs. No. 2 is safety. No. 1 is a roof over your head and enough to eat, or enough money to be able to provide those.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only things that this government is actually strong on are weakness and incompetence when it comes to managing immigration and the economy. We know that the government's first responsibility to individual Australians, to the general public and to our nation really is to keep citizens safe in our own country—national security. Under the former immigration minister, the Prime Minister's mate who was unceremoniously booted to a portfolio with less stress following the NZYQ High Court decision, the Albanese government released 178 detainees from detention. In that cohort were seven murderers, 37 sex offenders and 72 violent offenders. The former immigration minister and the former home affairs minister—who was also booted to a less stressful portfolio, one a bit less susceptible to blunders of national security significance—didn't have a Plan B when that NZYQ decision by the High Court occurred. They weren't ready to protect Australians from the criminals that they let out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ministerial submissions released under the FOI laws and published by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> confirm that Labor had released detainees with no visa and therefore no safeguards such as reporting conditions or monitoring devices. That should be frightening. It should be ringing alarm bells for Australians. Former minister Giles then misled the parliament on 15 November, 2023, when he said during question time:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I can confirm that all of those individuals required to be released as a result of the decision of the High Court are on bridging visas with appropriate conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Prime Minister proceeded with reshuffling his ministers, and now we have the member for Watson, who has four portfolios, including home affairs and immigration. I'm sure members opposite will have a great time on that particular point that I just made, but think back to the last time the member for Watson was the immigration minister, in 2013, when 83 asylum seeker boats arrived in 80 days. That's a pretty good strike rate if you're in sales, but it's not a very good strike rate if you are in immigration, so let's see what will happen under his watch.</span>

                  </a>  Now, Australia is a generous nation with a big heart, and we punch above our weight when it comes to supporting refugees. We have a history of supporting refugees from other conflict zones—those 12,000 from Syria, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, and those from Afghanistan—but this government has issued almost 3,000 visas to people from the Occupied Palestinian Territories, but we do not know how many people were subject to a clearance from our security agencies. In contrast, the UK granted 168 protection visas, 153 temporary residence visas have been approved by New Zealand, and the US has accepted 17, so these countries have been more cautious as to who they let in and the time that they take to do that. It is not so with this government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not about racism, as the member for Warringah shamelessly said in this chamber. This is about averting a public safety disaster should the proper processing steps not be followed by this government. Face-to-face interviews by Australian officials in neighbouring countries like Jordan, as we did in the Syrian crisis, would be acceptable.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I haven't got a lot of time left to talk about the failure of this government on the economy, but Australians know. They are hurting. They can't pay their bills. I would ask them to look back to before the last election, think about the promises that were made to them that life would be easier and ask themselves the question: is it?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:50</span>):  We live in times of great global uncertainty. Although the Albanese government is unable to control global economic issues and events, we can control how we respond to them. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite, we aren't seeking to frighten the Australian population. We aren't seeking to divide Australians. We are seeking to lift them up. We are seeking to take the pressure off. We are giving every Australian taxpayer a tax cut. We have increased the wages for many tens of thousands of Australians, putting more money into their pay packets every week. We have cut $1 trillion of debt. We have delivered two surpluses off the back of almost a decade of waste and deficits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have not treated the Australian people as mugs, and we certainly did not have mugs made to celebrate our surpluses. We have determinedly, calmly and sensibly, under the leadership of Anthony Albanese and his cabinet, charted a path for Australians that sees their lives measurably better. As the Treasurer ably pointed out today, we had inflation with a six in front of it when we took control of our economy and the Treasury coffers. That inflation now has a three in front of it. As a government, we don't completely control inflation—a little bit like global events—but our Treasurer has worked tirelessly with business leaders and with people who do have a good understanding of the economics of our nation to bring down that figure. That's what Australians care about, because that's what impacts their mortgages. That's what impacts the pressure that they have to withstand day to day in their lives.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be frank. The previous government left us with a massive train wreck to clean up. The Albanese government isn't satisfied with just patching up the holes. We plan to fix up this mess properly. Whilst in government, we've delivered for the Australian people, as governments should do. We have released policy after policy that makes a difference. We aren't claiming that it's easy at the moment, but we are saying that we are putting in place concrete policies that make a difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Paterson, 75,000 hardworking, taxpaying Australians will pay less tax under the Labor government, and that means something. That's measurable, and people can see it. We've delivered bill relief for every Australian household by way of our energy assistance. We have frozen the cost of the PBS. That's medicine that's coming to every Australian for less cost. That's important, because people value of their health in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have given a third consecutive pay rise to millions of Australians. We have expanded bulk-billing and we have made child care cheaper whilst paying properly those people who educate our children and who do care for them, which is so important. We have delivered fee-free TAFE. We have cut billions in student debt for those people who are going to university. We are planning for a future made in Australia. We want to make things here. We want people to be well paid. We have a course that has been thought through and is being sensibly charted. We are not seeking to divide the Australian people and put fear in their hearts. We are leading them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="124514" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:55</span>):  In this place we all agree—or, at least, I think we all agree—that the No. 1 responsibility of government is to keep its citizens safe. I have now lost count of the number of times this Albanese government has failed in its most primary responsibility through its fundamental failure to carefully manage Australian's immigration system. This week it has been laid bare that no robust vetting processes were applied to the 2,922 tourist visas issued to people coming from Gaza. Of the 1,300 who have used their visa to come to Australia, despite persistent questioning this week, we do not know how many of these tourists were required to undertake face-to-face interviews or subjected to biometric testing to make sure that we were not bringing into Australia anyone who was involved in the 7 October attacks, anyone who participated in the ransacking or looting which followed, anyone who supported or housed terrorists or weapons or anyone who in any other way supported the extremists or terrorism sympathisers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ability to live in Australia is the most precious of privileges. We are a free, democratic, liberal, pluralistic and tolerant society. Like all of us in this place, I get to attend citizenship ceremonies. They are instances of the most pure joy as we recognise and thank those who have left their homes to create prosperous, productive lives for their families in this beautiful country. Australia's immigration system gives us in this place the right to decide who comes to Australia and the circumstances in which they come, and that places on our shoulders the responsibility of guarding Australia's borders and looking after her people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite seem to care none for that responsibility. The granting of visas without the necessary rigor undermines trust in our migration system. The issuance of tourist visas en masse, knowing full well that the recipients of them were unlikely to go home, mocks the sacrifice and endeavour of every immigrant who has come to this country. This week we learned almost 3,000 visas have been granted, most in less than 24 hours. Tens of questions to the Prime Minister this week have not revealed whether any security checks had been done before their issuance. Those opposite have argued that this is the same system as every other time we have brought people here from a war zone. Really? The humanitarian visas granted to Syrians in 2017 involved biometric tests, face-to-face interviews in third-party countries where necessary and crosschecking with US intelligence datasets. At the moment, Australia is unique in its willingness to hand over visas, ones usually provided to tourists coming here for a holiday, to people from a war zone currently controlled by a terrorist group. It is worth noting, once again, how cautious our key intelligence partners have been. Canada has issued 254 visas, the United Kingdom has issued 168, New Zealand has issued 153 and the USA has issued just 17. Even France, which has a long history of working with the people of the Occupied Palestinian Territories, has allowed only 260 entries from Gaza.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gaza is a war zone. Its ruling authority, terrorist organisation Hamas, undertook the most devastating slaughter of 1,200 Jewish and Arab Israelis on 7 October. It was the greatest massacre of Jewish people since the Second World War. It is not a war like others in which professional soldiers fight professional soldiers. As my friend the member for Berowra said in his question to the Prime Minister today where he described some of what happened on that day, on 7 October 7 Hamas terrorists went into small Israeli farming villages and a music festival, where they filmed themselves gleefully murdering children, raping women and mutilating their victims, including after death. Thirteen hundred innocent people were hunted down and murdered for sport, and 251 hostages were forced at gunpoint into Hamas tunnels under Gaza. On their return, thousands of people were dancing in the street in celebration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was an attack of abject horror, with no respect for human life, human dignity or, indeed, humanity. The acts of the terrorists were disgusting, repulsive actions of unimaginable horror executed against those who until then had lived in relative harmony with their Gazan neighbours. The Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research's June poll of this year showed so much support for Hamas's October 7 attacks, and with this level of support we must ask more questions about who comes here.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="F2S" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SCRYMGOUR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  Before I start, I want to talk about the hypocrisy of the opposition. Some of us on this side remember the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa</span>. I certainly remember the <span style="font-style:italic;">Minasa Bone</span> and other boats that came in through the Tiwi Islands and the shambolic way in which the Liberal minister dealt with those issues at that time. Part of that was to excise all of the waters in the Top End or around the coast from classification as Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side, Labor has worked hard to help Australians with the cost of living. That's what we want to know about. We fight for and care for everyday Australians with regard to the cost of living. We know there is still more to do, particularly in regional and remote Northern Territory, my electorate, with tax cuts and energy rebates. A lot of students are in regional Northern Territory, and wiping student debts is really important. The labour budget is delivering cost-of-living relief for every Australian, particularly including my constituents in Lingiari. Cost of living continues to be a major concern for us in the Territory, particularly across my electorate of Lingiari.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 July, Labor delivered a tax cut, and it's been great getting around the electorate and talking to people who have done their tax returns and who will be getting some money back from doing their tax. People living in my area of regional and remote Lingiari are no different from others who are looking forward to some of that cost-of-living relief. There are 43,000 taxpayers in Lingiari, enjoying an average tax cut of around $1,621. It doesn't matter who you are or what you earn; every taxpayer will pay less tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the cost of living, my constituents are feeling pressure from higher global energy prices. From 1 July, we're delivering $300 of energy bill relief for every Australian household, including my residents in Lingiari. We're also providing small business with energy relief of $325, which is good for local business and local consumers. Labor is putting small business at the centre of future growth of our economy by extending for a further 12 months the $20,000 instant asset write-off and talking to a lot of small businesses. They are certainly looking forward to that. On paid parental leave, we are talking to a lot of new parents—particularly women. They are certainly happy with the 26 weeks of paid parental leave with super now included. In the six months before the last election, the financial viability of general practice this was in serious trouble. In terms of GP visits being bulk-billed, in my electorate of the Northern Territory, bulk-billing has increased by 4.8 per cent. That's thanks to Labor's investment in strengthening Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also seen with the urgent care clinic—with residents in my electorate of Lingiari and particularly in Alice Springs—10,700 visits to Mparntwe and the Palmerston Medicare urgent care clinics. They have been fantastic clinics that have been established. It certainly takes the burden and eases that burden in terms of accident and emergency. Labor's cost-of-living measures are making a real difference to everyday Australians and particularly to those residents who are doing it tough in my electorate of Lingiari. Our cost-of-living measures are part of Labor's long-term economic plan, helping all Australians right now, and working to bring down inflation and planning a future made in Australia, which is also important for my electorate of Lingiari.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="235654" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOLAHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  In this matter of public importance, I would like to begin by referring to the wording of the topic and the order of the words chosen. It says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This government's failure to keep Australians safe and the economy strong. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is put in that order because that is the order of priority. Of course Australians are suffering throughout this country and the cost of living is chief amongst them, and a very close second is housing. But we put 'keeping Australians safe' first because that is the fundamental duty of government. To follow on from my friend, the member for Flinders, who referred to the specific incidents and the specific crimes that occurred on 7 October, it is more than just keeping Australians safe. It is about keeping children safe. The people who prosecuted that attack on that day attacked teenagers at a concert, children in their homes and babies in their cots. This isn't some isolated part of the world that has no connection to us. You only have to open a newspaper to see that concerts run by Taylor Swift get cancelled because of a fear of teenagers being killed and attacked. So when we turn our mind to keeping Australians safe, let's not forget what is at stake. It is everything. What we have seen in the last two weeks has been a race to the gutter not only by the crossbench but by the government. When we have asked proper questions about that crucial topic, some have used the word 'racist', but then others have used euphemisms like 'divide' and 'fear' as if that's okay and that they're not hinting at the very same thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise here as a migrant to this nation and as someone who is only alive because of the courage of people of Muslim faith who saved my life. I never forget that. I acknowledge their contributions in saving many Australians' lives in the war in Afghanistan and in other wars. There would be many more names on that war memorial, and I would count my own amongst them. When we ask questions like this and the allegation is thrown out that we're doing it as some sort of discrimination against Palestinians or Muslims, I totally reject that and I totally reject that any of my colleagues think otherwise. Think about what you are saying. You are saying, if that is true, that a huge percentage of the House of Representatives are people of such bad character that they think that poorly of people of a dominant faith in this country. It cannot be true, you know it's not true and it shouldn't be prosecuted that way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my experiences in a conflict zone, I also know this to be true: we hear of the fog of war and many think of the fog of war as that moment when there's incomplete information and a particular person has their fight or flight system kick in—their mouth is dry, their heart is racing—because they don't know what is happening in all of the chaos that is in war. But the fog of war applies to information too. Again and again we had on-the-ground missions confirm that the intelligence we were given was wrong. It happened all the time. I noticed it when I had the experience as someone who worked in a headquarters and then became a platoon commander. Getting on the ground and looking people in the eye is the only form of intelligence and information that you can rely on. Yet what we have seen from this government is a cavalier attitude to that process—a complete dismissal of it. We've had the Treasurer and many others get up and say, 'Well, why aren't you asking questions about the cost of living?' The government didn't answer the questions that we put to them. In fact, there was a bristling that we dared even ask them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go to some of the questions. I asked about the cancellation of visas. The Prime Minister talked about a journalist and said only that any cancellations were offshore. I asked about visa security vetting, and he talked about robodebt. Asked if he was making Australia less safe, he talked about Sir Robert Menzies. Asked about face-to-face interviews and biometric testing—again, the only vetting that matters—the Prime Minister talked about the coalition. And today, when asked about what the state police and federal police have told him, what did he reply? He talked about nominations for councils in New South Wales.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  The Peter principle is a concept in management which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to a level of respective incompetence. Employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent. It's hard to find a better example of people embodying the Peter principle than in a week where the opposition has vacated the field on the economy and think undermining social cohesion and the work of national security agencies is talking tough. All it's shown the Australian people is their true character. They're not turning up on the issues that matter and are obsessed with the politics of division.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government will always show up, take responsibility and bring people together to find solutions to the problems facing Australia. We know Australians are doing it tough right now. That's why we're doing everything we can to help with the cost of living without adding pressure to inflation. That's why we are relieving cost-of-living pressures with cheaper child care, cheaper medicines, strengthened paid parental leave and fee-free TAFE. That's why we're investing record amounts into Medicare and bulk-billing. And that's why we're building new homes, investing in affordable housing and making renting fairer. Already we have seen bulk-billing rates across Canberra increased by 5.6 per cent, equating to an additional 17,417 bulk-billed GP visits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are creating a record number of jobs in Australia, ensuring that workers in critical sectors receive increased wages. This includes 2.6 million Australians who are receiving real wages growth due to proper increases in the minimum wage and, as recently announced, the 15 per cent wage increase for early childhood education and care workers. People in these sectors are vital workers in the Australian community and economy. And all Australian workers are benefiting from the Albanese Labor government's tax cuts, which ensure that every taxpayer pays less tax. Of the 82,000 people in Bean, every single taxpayer received this tax cut. We are ensuring that Australians are earning more and keeping more of what they earn. This morning the member for Kingston was in this chamber, moving vital amendments for paid parental leave and superannuation, ensuring that Australians are earning more and keeping more of what they earn in the immediate future but also ensuring that they're set up for the future and have security in retirement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For much of this week, we've been discussing a future made in Australia and the opportunities this presents for the Australian people and economy. We are taking actions to ensure that Australia is an active participant and player in a rapidly changing global marketplace by driving investment in new industries and encouraging the creation of secure jobs. We are giving the Australian people and Australian businesses every opportunity to thrive, while those opposite, through a nuclear haze, can't refrain from talking Australian manufacturing down. Just earlier this afternoon, we were discussing the Universities Accord and our work to reform the HECS-HELP system to ensure that Australians of all backgrounds can access higher education. It's a key to our future prosperity and to ensure that debts are not allowed to balloon to levels that place higher education out of reach. These are the actions the Albanese Labor government is taking to ensure Australians are supported. Where was the opposition when these meaningful actions were being taken? They were doing what they always do: saying no. I think the Prime Minister summed it up best yesterday: nastiness is not strength, and it can't disguise an opposition that embodies the Peter principle.</span>

I suspect, as far as I know at the moment, that that's the only one we'll be dealing with. If there are further messages in possession of the House, I'll let people know straightaway, but my understanding is that the NDIS is the only one. My understanding is that there are two groups of amendments that will be put separately because there are different majorities and different views that people have across them, and no doubt there will be some short debate. My expectation, though, is that we will probably still be in a situation before five o'clock where I move that the House adjourn. My apologies go to the people who were listed for the adjournment debate because I suspect we won't have time to have that in the normal way. The most important thing is that we deal with the legislation on the NDIS that's come back to us from the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  I'd like to indicate to the House that the government proposes that it may suit the convenience of the House to consider the amendments in the following two groups. The first group is amendments (1) and (2), (4) to (48), (50) to (67), (69) and (70). The other group is amendments (3), (49) and (68). I move:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That Senate amendments (1) and (2), (4) to (48), (50) to (67), (69) and (70) be agreed to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll briefly talk about the amendments. This is landmark legislation, and I am grateful for the effort of the Senate in voting it through today. It's fulfilling a commitment by the Australian government to legislate important changes called for by the independent review of the NDIS and following much engagement with the disability community, stakeholders and indeed state and territory governments. The government has made a number of amendments to strengthen this important legislation. They're in response to the feedback, and we'll continue to listen once the legislation is passed, if it's passed, as the reforms are co-designed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically referring to a range of the amendments, in June the government took the bill to the Senate. We proposed 18 amendments to reflect the recommendations of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The amendments respond to recommendations made by the committee, including governance, whereby first ministers are also recognised as ministers for the purpose of category A rulemaking; consultation, whereby a consultation statement will be tabled accompanying the legislative instrument that sets out consultations undertaken on the instrument; and safeguards, whereby government will clarify the circumstances under which the additional powers granted to the NDIS CEO through the bill will be used. The final amendment headed off concerns about the ability of the assessment to deliver a whole-of-person budget deemed a benefit of the legislation for participants and government alike. In addition government introduced further amendments to the Senate last week. These amendments are a combination of strengthening scheme integrity and responding to feedback on the bill from the disability community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The integrity amendments are adding integrity as a statutory function of the NDIA. This gives the NDIA the focus and authority to support more fraud and payment integrity work in the future. They're setting minimum requirements for payment claims. Basically, this is a form to be completed for a claim to be valid and paid. This will help discourage fraud. They're also setting a maximum time for a payment claim. A claim needs to be made within two years of being provided. It stops a loophole that we have detected where claims are made from so long ago no-one can actually verify if the support was delivered or not. Also, we want to ensure that a debt can be waived if a participant unintentionally or unknowingly breaches the acts or the rules. At the moment in the current legislation your disability isn't a special circumstance to waive a debt, yet clearly in some cases we have seen where debts have been incurred the participant has, by virtue of their disability, erred and for no other reason. So this prevents debts being made in the circumstance where a person's disability triggered the mistake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments that respond to feedback require participants to be notified which impairment or impairments they've met to access the NDIS for and be transparent about whether the participant has an intellectual, cognitive, neurological, sensory and/or physical impairment that meets the access requirements to the scheme. They will also allow it to be reviewed. I would like to acknowledge Senator David Pocock's contribution in developing these particular amendments to impairment notices and for engaging in good faith with the government and the community to deliver a good outcome for people with disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also going to seek to create an exceptional circumstance clause to the list of banned supports. This would allow a participant to buy another otherwise banned support where it's just more appropriate and cost-effective than a disability support. As a brief example, a vision impaired participant could purchase a Samsung Galaxy watch for $500 to use voice assistance to read writing. It's cheaper than using a support worker for $73 an hour to walk around with a participant. However, not every person should be buying Samsung watches with NDIS funding. It's about looking at the person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are further amendments following discussions with the states and territories this week to enhance co-governance arrangements of the scheme. These additional amendments were introduced into the Senate to contemporise the co-governance arrangements for the scheme. The arrangements that are being adopted reflect the significant number of forms required to the NDIS over the next two terms of parliament. These changes are overdue. Since co-governance arrangements have not been changed since the inception of the scheme, they modernise the approval process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS bill will implement a number of key changes that will need unanimous agreement as the majority of changes will be made through category A rules. The states will need to agree with these changes to enable implementation across the country. These amendments include a newly defined category A rule that's subject to a dispute resolution process which includes an escalation model to bring disagreements to the attention of the Prime Minister and first ministers for resolution. Once escalated, the approval can be achieved not from a veto requiring the acceptance of every state but from just a majority agreement by states. There are also strict timeframes introduced for the prompt consideration of category A rules under the new process. There is a conversion of ministerial legislative instrument-making powers in the bill to newly defined category A rules, with exceptions for instruments that are required from commencement, which will remain instruments until the rules are agreed. There is an abbreviated process for making changes to needs assessed in budget setting tools where there are no substantial policy financial implications. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also include scheme sustainability in the short to medium term and support the National Cabinet decision to achieve the eight per cent growth target. I acknowledge particularly the work of Premiers Rockliff and Malinauskas on this. The amendments mean the states will be required to develop a co-designed reform with participants, the disability community and the Commonwealth to give effect to NDIS reforms and foundational supports. I also wish to put on record the constructive negotiations I have had with the shadow minister, the member for Deakin, in trying to get a good outcome for people with a disability.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="242515" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  This is the culmination of a longwinded and, in some respects, tortured process. I know it was a suboptimal process for many in the disability sector. But, to touch on the minister's final couple of remarks there, I think it was an indication that where the government and opposition start in two different places but come together in good faith and in the best interests of our country we can reach agreement. We will be agreeing with the first tranche of amendments moved to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said at the beginning: a tortured process. There have been 97 amendments to this bill from its inception, which fly in the face of claims from the government at the time that this was a perfect, fully formed bill, not requiring much attention, including their later claims that the work being done by the Senate inquiry was unnecessary and just costing the scheme. We've seen dozens of amendments flow out of that further Senate inquiry. In that respect, I want to place on record my gratitude to all of the senators who undertook a lot of painstaking work hearing from advocates as part of that inquiry and making up for the shortfalls in the consultation that the government undertook. In that respect, I want to thank, in particular, Senator Hughes for her leadership in that Senate inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has ultimately driven the opposition to support this bill and, in particular, these groups of amendments, is the overarching objective, as stated by the minister, to ensure a number of things, but, first and foremost, the sustainability of the NDIS into the future. We on this side of the chamber have been talking about sustainability for a long time. We have been talking about sustainability in the NDIS when it wasn't a bipartisan view, when, in fact, we had a lot of opposition from the then opposition Labor Party in relation to those views. We were very critical of the opposition at that time for not being constructive in opposition and for using the NDIS for political purposes. Because we had made those accusations of the Labor opposition, it would have been wholly hypocritical for us to have gone down the same path and used this for political purposes, which, quite frankly, I could have as shadow minister and we could have as an opposition. So, in the vein of not being hypocritical, we have sought to support the government in a number of worthy amendments to the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are things that have been self-evident concerns of many for a very long time. I don't underestimate how hard it's been for the minister at times in facing down a lot of the unprincipled attacks, which, quite frankly, we faced when we were in government, including from the then opposition; nonetheless, he has faced those down. That's a credit to him for doing that. In that respect, we're very happy to support these amendments. These amendments encompass negotiated amendments between ourselves and the government. For those people in the gallery and for those people watching—of whom I don't think there are probably that many at nearly five o'clock on a Thursday—there is a lot of argy-bargy that goes on in this House but also a lot of good work and negotiation that has gone on behind the scenes between my office, the minister's office and our respective leaders. In the amendments that we progressed with the government, we were very keen to ensure the integrity of the scheme. The minister used the term 'integrity' a lot. When we talk about the financial sustainability of the scheme, intertwined with that is the broad public support and acceptance of this huge amount of money, and nothing erodes that broad public acceptance more than some of the abuse and the affray that we see splashed over our papers on a daily basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why we were very keen to move self-evident amendments of what people could use their plans for—that doesn't include prostitutes, that doesn't include alcohol, that doesn't include drugs—things that we think build on the acceptance, we hope, of a community that this is a scheme that is changing people's lives and that is ensuring that government does for people with a disability what it should be doing. When you boil government down to its absolute barest, if government is not here to support Australians with a disability, what on earth are we here for? Ensuring that the scheme has broad support in the community will be enhanced by these amendments. That's why we will support it. That's why we will support the ultimate bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WATSON-BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  Today is a very sad day for the disability community. They have been absolutely betrayed by the Labor government, a government that has broken its promise. The promise was that there would be no discussion about cutting the funds to the scheme. What passed the Senate today will see the most significant changes to the NDIS since it started more than a decade ago. This is a huge blow to the disability community, a proud community that deserves so much better from this government. So today I'm angry, I'm sad and I'm so disappointed that I will have to return to my constituents—people who I admire and who have come to me for help to navigate the already plagued system of the NDIS—and I'll have to tell them that this government has ripped billions of dollars of funding from a system that was supposed to support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We already know that the NDIS can't handle the current workload even with its current funding. It doesn't take a genius to realise that a $14.4 billion funding shortfall and an increase in workload for staff mean that people are going to fall through the cracks and suffer. It's so clear that this is a thinly veiled attempt to remove support for people or kick them off the NDIS altogether. They're going to restrict support, remove provisions for individualising plans and try to standardise assessments—mandatory assessments that this government is trying to make people, who will likely have had their funds cut, pay for themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disability is not standardised, and it should never be treated as such. We've already seen the fallout of this sort of attempt at categorisation in menstrual products being wrongly classified. The minister apologised for this mistake only after advocates brought it to the attention of the media. That's fundamentally the problem with the sorts of lists that they're proposing in this bill. They just shouldn't exist. They attempt to categorise complex human needs into bureaucratic tick boxes, ignoring people's needs, their experiences and their choices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people on the NDIS have shared with me already the feeling that the government doesn't care about them, and this rubs salt into those wounds. Labor has sent a very clear message to disabled people. They don't care about your goals, your aspirations or your agency. The Albanese government boasts a $9 billion surplus, but, to be crystal clear, that surplus is off the back of the NDIS, off the back of every single person that has needed to access this support. The government should be ashamed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="297660" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:32</span>):  The National Disability Insurance Scheme is of the utmost importance to those who depend on it. It enables disabled people to receive the supportive treatment that they need. It's inevitable that any significant changes to the scheme engender significant uncertainty in NDIS recipients. We know that the scheme needs to change and that its cost has blown out to unacceptable levels. The disability community knows that change is inevitable. But the apparent haste with which this legislation has been put together, the lack of detail about the changes anticipated and the extent to which they have been left to the delegated legislation has resulted in insecurity, fear and even trauma to scheme recipients and those who care for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has said in the last 24 hours that passage of this legislation will be 'the construction of the scaffolding' that will enable co-design to begin. That means that work will start now on exactly how needs assessments will work and how these foundational services will work. But the disability community remains apprehensive. After all, they are the people whose daily lives will be impacted by this law. The rest of us will move on, but this is their life. They may resent the NDIS. They may rail against it and against people like us who make huge laws with huge impacts on their lives. But they need the NDIS and many, many people say that, for them, it has been transformative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many in the community remain really nervous about this legislation and about the changes that have been made even in the last 24 hours—changes which will affect them every day in their daily lives. They say it's imperfect and incomplete, and I agree with them. They say that they are struggling to trust the process and in the government, and I can see why that is. It's not just the lack of detail in this legislation; it's the fact that the government has been so slow to respond to the NDIS review previously and then its recent inadequate response to the recommendations of the disability royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The co-design process is so important. It should have started months ago. The government should have secured agreements with the states and the territories on the nature of foundational services months ago. This legislation gives the government significantly increased powers over the lives of hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people. But there's an absence of detail on how those powers will be implemented. Of course, those people are nervous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've really struggled with whether or not to support this bill and these amendments. The opposition is now supporting it, despite having previously criticised it and despite the shadow assistant minister for the NDIS saying, as recently as yesterday, that this bill 'will throw good money after bad'. The Greens are going to vote against it. Let's face it: it's easier to say no than to say yes. It's always easier to tear something down than to build it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent months, I have worked hard with the minister, the department and the agency. I thank them for accepting the amendments moved in this House—in my name—and in the Senate today. Those amendments go some way, but only a small way, to addressing the concerns of the disability community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to support this legislation today because I know that there is an urgent need to improve the NDIS. But I note that this is just the start of that process. The most important pieces of this legislation are not yet written. They'll be in the delegated legislation, and we will see them in tranches over the next few months to years. So, I ask the many individuals, the carers, the disability organisations and the health care professionals, who care about how that delegated legislation looks and how it will work, to help me and my colleagues review that legislation as it comes to hand. Together, we will continue to hold this government to account. Together, we will continue to work with all sides of this parliament to make the NDIS better. I commend this legislation to the House but with reservations and with a commitment to continue to work to improve it as it evolves.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  I'm going to briefly respond to the member for Ryan's intellectually dishonest submissions, which the Greens party has been perpetuating. She didn't actually go to any of the amendments that are in front of us, but I'm going to call out the lies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member, who clearly doesn't know too much about the NDIS—although she might have helped some constituents through contacting my office to help them—said that we are proposing lists and that this is a terrible new development. I have news for the member. There have been lists since day one in the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you read the act, you'll see that it spells out that there are things which are the responsibility of other services, and then it says there are things which money should be spent on and things that it shouldn't be spent on. All we are doing is converting from an operational guideline to a regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, on the cowardly outrage fanning the flames of fear from the Greens, they neglected to say that the disability community, for the first time, is being consulted on the list. I note that neither you nor anyone in the Greens party in the last 10 years has ever complained about the list not being consulted on. But, all of a sudden, the member for Ryan has found her voice. What's worse about it is that the Greens political party put up several amendments, but they've been running behind those amendments—wisely, the member for Ryan didn't even bother—and accusing the government of getting rid of the concept of 'reasonable and necessary'. 'Reasonable and necessary' will be at the core of the scheme. I don't expect the Greens to have the honesty to withdraw the lie, but they're wrong; I've put it on the record. We will keep the concept of 'reasonable and necessary'. We're told by the Greens that there is no co-design. Under me, the NDIA has 23 co-design groups, and you're welcome to come and visit; I'm not holding my breath. So, there have been lists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The real debate here is that there are three options for the future of the scheme. Unlike the member for Ryan, I was there at the start of the scheme. I was there before there was a scheme. You weren't. There are three options for the future of this scheme. The first is to do nothing. Just let it keep growing at 20 per cent. That would be very dangerous. Heaven help Australia if the Greens political party were ever actually in charge of the NDIS. You would be a train wreck for people with disability. They say that this is a cut. Lies, lies, lies! Every year Labor has been in and, to be fair, every year that the Liberals have been in, the investment in the NDIS has gone up, not down. We want a growth of eight per cent; 20 per cent is unsustainable. The Greens are lucky enough to live in a world where money doesn't matter, where it just grows on trees—all things to all people. I love the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another option to the Greens' neo-conservatism, to the 'do nothing' approach. There is slash and burn. Cap it; we're not doing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third option is just to make it better for the participants. I haven't been stuck in a traffic jam of the Greens and their white political limos coming to see me about their constructive future. They are willing to drive past the rorts, the frauds and the overservicing. When I proposed new regulations to make it illegal for a service to provide a higher price to an NDIS participant than someone not on the scheme—the so-called wedding tax, where someone sees the NDIS badge and ups the price—do you know how much correspondence I got from the Greens on it? Zip, because they don't know what's happening. Every time Labor proposes a change, they look at it through the political calculus of 'How can we gain a few more votes?' Don't shake your head. The reality is the Greens political party lied about the standardisation, they've lied about the lists and they've told lies about cuts. The reality is, we want this scheme to grow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor—and now with the support of the coalition, which I acknowledge—we're aiming at an eight per cent target. We do want to build supports outside the scheme. The Greens have very little to say about building inclusion outside. The NDIS is a great chapter in the history of disability in Australia, but it's not the book. We want to write a new chapter about foundational services working with the states. Heaven help us if the Greens were ever in charge of the NDIS because they are dangerous. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are amendments moved by Senator Thorpe. Senator Thorpe has proposed amendments that the government is willing to support. They amend section 127 of the NDIS Act to provide that the minister must ensure at least one board member is an Indigenous person. Fortunately, we've already done that, even without the requirement of legislation. We've got a great Larrakia man on the board with lived experience—Dr Richard Fejo, whom I appointed in March 2023. I'm pretty sure I never had a letter from the Greens on that.</span>

I acknowledge Senator Thorpe's significant work and contribution on priority reforms, embedding Indigenous leadership in the government's NDIS, and highlighting the importance of culture in the social and emotional wellbeing of participants of the NDIS.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—Assistant Minister for Immigration) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:30</span>):  Recently I was delighted to attend the 90th anniversary celebrations for the Australasian Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, affectionately known as AHEPA. I joined His Grace Bishop Iakovos of Miletoupolis along with Theo Skhinas, the grand president of the Grand Lodge of AHEPA, Sophia Notaras, the national supreme president of AHEPA, and many more Australians of Hellenic heritage to celebrate nearly a century of heritage service and culture enrichment. AHEPA today is a beacon of Hellenism and a testament to the enduring spirit of the Greek community and their contribution to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This country's connection with Greece is profound, from our capital cities to our towns, like Werris Creek, Gunnedah and Scone, all of which have been an important part of the formation of AHEPA. Greeks have done so much to shape the face of our modern nation. In my own electorate of Kingsford Smith we've got a thriving Greek community. The year 2024 holds additional significance for the Greek Orthodox community, with the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Holy Archdiocese of Australia and New Zealand. AHEPA members are united in their commitment to philanthropy, education and cultural exchange. Their charitable endeavours, from medical research to support for the aged and disadvantaged, reflect the very best of that ethos. Congratulations and thank you to everyone involved in AHEPA over the last 90 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge 40 years of wonderful service by Rabbi Elozer Gestetner and Rebbetzin Miri Gestetner. Together they've led the Coogee Synagogue for 40 years over this special time. Recently I was delighted to join hundreds of people from the local Jewish community to celebrate their leadership of the congregation. It's another milestone for an amazing couple, who are the longest serving Jewish congregation leaders in Australia. That's something that our community is very proud of. Rabbi Elozer and Miri have led the services and the pastoral care of their community for that period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Coogee Synagogue is known as 'the great little central synagogue by the sea'. It was founded in 1950 by Holocaust survivors who left the devastation of post-war Europe for a new beginning in our community. Under the leadership of Elozer and Miri, the Coogee Synagogue has grown to a membership of now over 300, and over the past 40 years the Gestetners have officiated at 515 bar and bat mitzvahs—in itself an amazing achievement. They're wonderful contributors to our community and they're much beloved. Miri runs a wonderful childcare and community centre there, and they do so much for our community. Congratulations to Elozer and Miri Gestetner.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:33</span>):  August is Tradies National Health Month, a time to invest in tradie health. While the original intent of Tradies National Health Month is to encourage tradies to invest in their physical health, I want to take this opportunity to talk about mental health. One in five Australians will develop a mental health condition at some stage in their lives. Anxiety and depression are the most common mental illnesses in Australia. Everyone is vulnerable to experiencing mental ill health at some point, even tradies. It affects people regardless of age, education, income or culture. Building strong friendships with your mates and working with a crew you can trust is a great way to keep mentally well, as well as looking out for others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My message here today is: don't ever forget the power of a simple conversation. This TradeMutt shirt that I'm wearing may not strictly meet the parliamentary dress code, but it's important for mental health amongst tradies. They're designed to make the invisible impossible to ignore and to get blue-collar Aussies talking about how they're really doing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015 TradeMutt co-founder and carpenter Dan Allen lost his best mate to suicide. His apprentice and co-founder Ed Ross was Dan's support as he worked through the aftermath, trying to process the grief. It was during that time that Dan and Ed recognised the closed-off conversationalist culture on worksites around the country. There was a lack of meaningful conversations about life's struggles. The shirts were developed to start the necessary conversation amongst tradies, and the counselling services soon followed. When you need a little more than a conversation with a mate, the best thing to do is to reach out to a professional. While many tradies are still reluctant to seek professional help, it doesn't have to be that daunting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'This Is A Conversation Starter', or TIACS as it is now known, doesn't just make great shirts like this one. The organisation provides professional mental health counselling to Australia's blue-collar community. TIACS removes the physical and financial barriers to accessing help through a simple text and call service directly to professional counsellors. It's free, it's professional and it's confidential. It's available between the hours of eight in the morning and 10 at night, via text or call, and, most importantly, it's designed specifically for the blue-collar workforce, meaning that, whether you're a tradie, a farmer or a truck driver, they'll speak your language. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, if you want to take your first step to improving your mental health this Tradies National Health Month, start the conversation by texting 0488846988, and a TIACS crew will be there to listen and work with you to make a real difference.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:36</span>):  In a local government area that is 3,000 kilometres square, roads matter. I want to highlight the major funding role the Albanese Labor government has in supporting Hawkesbury council to improve local roads. This is on top of the tens of millions of dollars in disaster funding that has passed through to council through joint state-federal arrangements for road repairs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go through a quick list. One of my key election commitments was $11.2 million to improve local roads. Hawkesbury council has added $7 million to that program. That means 15 roads projects have started or are being delivered over the next 12 months. I'll run through some of the roads that council has chosen sections of: Kurmond Road, Kurmond; Argyle Street, Blackman Crescent, Berger Road and White Place, South Windsor; Grose Vale Road and Riverview Street, North Richmond; Comleroy Road, East Kurrajong; Spinks Road, Glossodia; Bowen Mountain Road; in Oakville and Maraylya, Oakville Road, Boundary Road and Scheyville Road; Wire Lane, Freemans Reach; and Packer Road, Blaxlands Ridge. I'm very pleased the Albanese government is the major funder of these improvements. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Black Spot Program also provides a source of funding for Hawkesbury council, another program we've increased funding for. The most recent round is $3.6 million for safety improvements at five known crash sites. They are at Old Pitt Town Road at Oakville, Freemans Reach Road, Tennyson Road, Spinks Road and Hanckel Road. The same program has previously provided more than a million dollars to upgrade part of St Albans Road and half a million dollars for Francis Street in Richmond. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But one of the really key sources of roads funding for Hawkesbury council is Roads to Recovery. Many of the roads you've seen already repaired in the Hawkesbury have been done under this funding. We're progressively doubling funding to $1 billion annually—twice what the Liberals provided. What that means is the Hawkesbury can count on $9.6 million for Roads to Recovery over the next five years. It starts with $1.4 million this financial year and continues to rise over the life of that five-year agreement. You'll have seen some of the funding in action, with work on Old Pitt Town Road at Oakville and Spinks Road, Glossodia, and East Kurrajong Road is also on the list, with a million-dollar investment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hawkesbury council is responsible for arranging for the work to be done, but there is no shortage of funds for the roads they've chosen as their priorities. This is serious funding, provided to your Hawkesbury council so they can do a better job of fixing the roads they're responsible for. Of course, this is on top of all of that council funding. There is funding for the New South Wales government. There's the $100 million we're providing to New South Wales to upgrade sections of Bells Line of Road plus the $400 million for the Richmond Bridge and approaches major project.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:39</span>):  I'm pleased to say show season is up and running in the mighty electorate of Durack. We've already had the Moondyne Festival in Toodyay, which I was pleased to attend earlier this year. It is a very special show, as people dressed in pioneer costumes are transformed back to the era of Moondyne Joe, with re-enactments of his escapades, arrest and mock trial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we may have just had the Summer Olympics in Paris, at the Kununurra Show there was the equally serious watermelon Olympics—another fantastic event showcasing the beautiful East Kimberley. We've recently had shows across the Pilbara, with the Spinifex Carnival in Port Hedland, the FeNaCING Festival in Karratha and the Outback Fortescue Festival in Newman. Together with the Pilbara Liberals, it was great to see the fantastic Liberal candidate for the electorate of the Pilbara, Amanda Kailis, there representing the regional Liberal team. The Mingenew Expo has just taken place—another great success, with many dropping by to participate in the world-famous jellybean counting competition to guess how many jellybeans are in the jar; I of course appreciate the counting efforts of my team!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next Wednesday I'm off to Dowerin, for their Machinery Field Days. This is an event that brings thousands of Western Australians from the city and the bush. I'm looking forward to catching up once again with the local farmers and also representatives from Keep the Sheep. I take this opportunity to invite the Prime Minister to Dowerin—but, a warning: if he does come I would caution him not to make any poor jokes about live export like he did the other night at the AgriFutures event, which was supposed to be about celebrating rural women. Unsurprisingly, jests about destroying people's livelihoods will not go down too well in Dowerin. My prediction is that the Labor tent at Dowerin is going to be a very lonely, sad place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Still to come are shows in Mullewa, Chapman Valley, York, Northam, Northampton, Moora and Toodyay. I am passionate about the shows and the agricultural field days in Durack. They provide a fantastic opportunity for people to 'accidentally' start a conversation with their local member. While we all know not all community members want to call by our offices or write a letter, many often stop by at the shows and take the opportunity to have a chat with their federal member. Understandably, my team and I have been hearing about the rising cost of living and the high interest rates which are causing tremendous pain for so many families across the Durack community. These shows don't just happen; they require hours and hours of volunteer time and focus. I thank all the show organisers and the hundreds of volunteers for all their hard work. You do your communities proud by continuing to hold these shows and set up these shows year after year. They are a centrepiece of every town's calendar.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:42</span>):  On Saturday last week Tathra lost a local legend, Rob Little—known as Frog to so many people. Frog and Val were publicans of the iconic Tathra pub during the eighties and nineties, and established it as the South Coast pub rock venue. They had the likes of Cold Chisel, Midnight Oil, INXS, Rose Tattoo and Mental as Anything perform there. Frog was a legend, and the 1957 Buddy Holly song 'Peggy Sue' was his favourite. All these now-household names knew they had to sing 'Peggy Sue' with him on stage as an encore on the night they performed. When Rose Tattoo performed, Angry Anderson came up to him and said, 'We won't do "Peggy Sue", mate,' and he said, 'That's fine; I didn't think a hard-rock band would do that.' Come the next year, Angry Anderson showed up and said to Frog, after he gave him a hug, 'We've been practising "Peggy Sue", mate.' This is the guy he was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was instrumental in starting the Tathra Sea Eagles AFL club, formed in 1983; he was the club's first president. He was a life member. He was instrumental in sponsoring players, giving players jobs and getting people to the club. He was so much more than just a person to the people that walked through the Lawrence Park gates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Frog was a man of deep passion and deep commitment, and he was a man of routine. He would go early-morning fishing, he would mow the lawns of a couple of businesses, he looked after his lemon trees and he would ring my husband every Wednesday night at 6 pm on the dot for months on end to make sure he could get Brad to the footy club. He is well known across our community and he will be deeply missed by everyone. Val, I know, at this point in time will be doing it tough, because Frog was her constant companion for many, many years. Frog is survived by Val; his three sons, Anthony, Doug and David; their wives; and his grandchildren. Vale, Frog. I look forward to getting down to Lawrence Park on the 30th for one last celebration, with VB in hand, with Buddy Holly songs going. We thank you for all that you have done for Tathra and for our community.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LLEW O'BRIEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:45</span>):  Today I rise to honour the memory of Wide Bay's great people, Mike Ostwald. Mike was a long-time resident of Gympie and Monto, and he recently passed away while visiting his daughter and granddaughters in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Mike's passing was mourned by many who travelled far to pay their respects at St Patrick's Catholic Church in Gympie. The funeral service was jointly conducted by Father Louie Jimenez of St Patrick's Parish and Father Mick Peters, a former schoolmate of Mike's from Nudgee college in Brisbane. The eulogy was delivered by Mike's eldest son, Mark Ostwald. The service was characteristic of an Ostwald affair, with significant music contributions performed by family members and the Gympie Pitch-In choir. Mike had a strong sense of community and was an active member of numerous community organisations, most of which were represented at the funeral and the wake. His life was characterised by a relentless devotion to self-reliance and independence, the kind of determination synonymous with his generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first 40 years of Mike's life were spent on a Monto dairy farm, after which he moved to the Gympie region and embarked on a career in real estate, specialising in agricultural properties across the Gympie and greater Wide Bay regions. Joined by his wife, Gina, Mike took a decade away from real estate to run a family-operated tourist park at Mary River on the Arnhem Highway in the Northern Territory, before returning to Gympie and restarting the real estate business. He continued to work in real estate well into his 70s, with some of his best years in business being his final ones. The great turnout observed at his funeral service and wake was a testament to the life he lived and the relationships he formed—a life well lived.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mike was a source of unwavering support, always there to offer guidance and encouragement. His love was a constant in the lives of his family and friends, and his absence leaves a void that words cannot fill. While we mourn the loss of Mike, we also celebrate the legacy he leaves behind. His spirit lives on in the values he imparted and the lives he touched and the love he shared. I extend my condolences to Gina and all of Mike's family. Rest in peace, Mike Ostwald.</span>

I had the pleasure of meeting Vansh and his mum, Drishti, before the tournament and presenting him with an Australian flag. He was the first-ever Australian black belt to perform at the closing Night of Victory. Returning this year, Vansh performed extremely well again. He finished the tournament with four championship wins and two bronze medals. He also won the Night of Victory Championship, making him the first Australian to win the event. I'd like to thank Drishti, Vansh's mum, for keeping me up to date with all of his achievements. Vansh represented not only himself but our community so well and has made us all proud. To see him pictured with his trophies and medals, holding up the Australian flag that I presented him a little over a year ago, was inspirational. His successes are amazing, given he is 13 years old, and I'm eager to see his continued success throughout his life and what his future holds. Best wishes in the next competition.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Celebrations for birthdays that end in zero are very important, and thankfully our community had a 60th birthday to celebrate last month. Established in July 1964, Quota Liverpool have been raising money to support those in need in our community since then. Over the last 60 years, the club has had over 167 members, and it boasts over a thousand combined years of membership. It was a privilege to speak at the event and, in a small way, acknowledge the dedication and work of Quota Liverpool. Acknowledgement and special thanks have to go to all of the families and friends who support the Quota ladies, helping with barbecues and filling tables for fundraising events.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the years, the club has supported children with speech therapy when their families couldn't afford the cost, made breakfast at school breakfast clubs and donated to the Shepherd Centre, women's refuges, Miracle Babies, the Cancer Council and melanoma research. The list is too long to complete here. On the day, the club had prepared 30 scrolls, which were read by attendees, each listing achievements, events and support over the last 60 years. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to president Julie Percival and all the organisers, especially June Young, a stalwart member of our community. No function is complete without a birthday cake, and the cake was cut by the longest-serving members, Judy Blackburn and Lorraine Perry. Please consider joining Quota Liverpool if you are able. I know they'd love some extra helping hands, and the difference that they make in our community so often is really important. If you've got some time, get in contact with    Quota Liverpool. You can do that by ringing our office, and I'll make sure that your details go through.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:51</span>):  I'm sure most members have the same challenge in their electorates as I do, which is a drastic shortage of quality sporting infrastructure for the great boom that is going on in sports participation, particularly female participation in traditionally male-dominated sports. It's very difficult in a long-developed community like mine to find new open-space opportunities to develop. Throughout the eastern and north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide, that is a problem across many sporting codes. Obviously, traditional clubs have their grounds, but as their membership is swelling, particularly with the growth in female participation in codes like Aussie rules, soccer and cricket, the clubs can't keep up with that excellent growth with their existing facilities. There are other sports that have lost their homes as land has been developed over the previous few decades and have, for a long time, had to make do with temporary or remote-to-their-location places to train and places to compete.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a very significant opportunity in my electorate, which I hope will not be lost, to develop a multipurpose piece of sporting and recreational infrastructure. The University of Adelaide and the University of South Australia have concluded plans to merge, and that obviously means that the various campuses of both institutions are coming together under the one banner. With that is the proposal to close down the Magill campus of the University of South Australia, which has a number of elements to it—particularly, significant heritage assets but also open-space playing fields. The state government are at this stage indicating that it will be developed to the highest-value use, which really means high-density housing. That decision needs to be reversed, and we need to protect that open space and, in fact, invest in that open space to be sporting infrastructure for the many clubs that would love the opportunity to create a home for themselves on that land. I'm talking particularly about the parcel east of St Bernards Road, opposite the UniSA Magill campus. It is a prime opportunity for open-space recreational sporting infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly will fight here in Canberra to help get the financial support to develop that land, but first the land needs to be made available. I urge the state government to reverse their decision to turn it into high-density housing and instead provide it to the local council so that we can work together to develop it into high-quality recreational sporting facilities for all the local residents of the eastern and north-eastern suburbs.</span>

Greensborough College is a fantastic school, where the principal, staff and students all embody the school values of courage, aspiration, respect and equality. On the same day I also visited Rosanna Primary School to present their semester-2 leaders with their awards. Again, it is a wonderful local school with staff, students and a truly caring principal who live their school values. As the local member, it's really heartening to see all these young people in our community flourishing and being set up for the best possible future. I'm proud to be a member of a Labor government that's doing the work of funding our public schools. We want to make sure that the extra money we've put on the table does make a difference to kids who really need it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Himilo Community Connect does really important work supporting our local Somali community in Jagajaga, so I am very pleased that the Albanese Labor government is supporting them with $100,000 in funding. Himilo is based at Bell St Mall and partners with a wide range of organisations, institutions and services to increase participation, build capacity, create valuable connections and open opportunities for success in education, employment, health and social cohesion. The $100,000 funding will be used to develop and deliver programs that promote social cohesion among young people in the Somali community, and this is especially important at this time. I would like to thank Himilo managers Abdiaziz Farah and Pam Burley, along with all their staff, who I know work so hard on behalf of the community and on addressing needs that are there. Abdi and Pam really show how deeply they care for our local Somali community and our wider community, and I'm so proud that the Albanese Labor government are able to work with them to deliver this important initiative.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Paralympics are upon us. Jaryd Clifford is a Jagajaga local who has always dreamed big, knowing from an early age that he wanted to be a Paralympian. Proudly raised in Jagajaga, Jaryd has proven himself to be a true inspiration and a source of pride for the Diamond Valley community. Jaryd began his athletics journey with the fantastic Diamond Valley Athletic Club, and I want to give a huge shout-out to them. I know they have continued to be incredibly supportive of Jaryd and of many other young people in our community who are pursuing their passion for athletics. Next week Jaryd will be competing in Paris in his third Paralympic Games, participating in the T12/13 visually impaired 1,500-metre and 5,000-metre events. Jaryd, you continue to inspire our community. We will all be watching you with pride. Go well! I am sure you will get the race you deserve, and we will all be backing you.</span>

                  </a>  In the 10 years between 2014 and 2024, all the teachers in the country together paid twice as much tax as the entire oil and gas sector. The government gets more money from HECS and related student loans than from the gas tax, the PRRT, which is designed to raise revenue from the oil and gas corporations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government fails to even mention the profiteering of the big corporations and the role that that plays in driving up the cost of living. Rather than cracking down on the big supermarkets, the Prime Minister is more likely to dress up in a Coles high-vis top and pose for photos with them, and, rather than making big mining corporations pay their fair share, the Prime Minister is more likely to have dressed up in a Rio Tinto shirt. That's because this Prime Minister is more concerned with managing the economy for the profits of big corporations and billionaires than he is with the concerns of everyday people. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Australians are struggling to keep a roof over their head, being smashed at the supermarket and paying too much on their power bills, the Labor government is backing big corporations. In the past year, in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, CEOs are giving themselves double-digit pay rises while many of the same corporations call for wage restraint from their workers. We now have over 3.3 million people living in poverty. The number of people who can't find an affordable place to live grows, as does the number of people who are homeless. People are skipping meals so their kids don't miss out. The country's economy is rigged. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and the Liberals both take huge donations from these big corporations. Labor and the Liberals have both refused to make them pay their fair share, and Labor and the Liberals have both refused to do anything about the price gouging from big corporations. People are fed up with the Coles and Woolies of politics ripping them off at every turn. It's why people tell me every day that they think it's harder and harder to tell Labor and the Liberals apart.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it doesn't have to be this way. We can make the big corporations pay their fair share of tax. We can make groceries cheaper by making price gouging illegal. We can freeze rent increases and drive down the cost of housing. If we make the big corporations pay their fair share of tax, we can actually get to the heart of what's driving the cost-of-living crisis and start to invest in people. Now, we know these changes are going to be tough to achieve and that they won't happen overnight, but the first step is voting for someone who will fight for you. You can't keep voting for the same two parties and expect a different result. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BYRNES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  I rise to speak to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Energy, Environment and Water's final report of the inquiry into the impact of plastic pollution on Australia's oceans and waterways. The report is titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Drowning </span><span style="font-style:italic;">in waste</span>: <span style="font-style:italic;">plastic pollution in Australia's oceans and waterways</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry was requested by the Minister for the Environment and Water, the Hon. Tanya Plibersek, in October 2022. It has had a particular lens on the impact of plastic pollution in oceans and waterways, including microplastics. The terms of reference set by the committee covered consideration of the effectiveness of Australia's management framework under the National Plastics Plan; the effectiveness of the Australian government's engagement with states, territories, industry and non-government organisations; the effectiveness of community campaigns; and current global initiatives. The committee received 71 submissions from around the country, representing a broad cross-section of government; the science and academic community; industry, including manufacturing, retail and peak organisations; environmental organisations; and community groups. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One submission that I would like to draw particular attention to is that of one of my constituents, Susie Crick. Susie is the CEO of the Oceanic Research Institute and branch president of the Surfrider Foundation. She is passionate about transitioning from plastics to more sustainable materials, and through her submission there is a harrowing quote that I thought of often during the inquiry. She said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will be challenging to make the shift from the convenience of plastic because we touch plastic more than we do our loved ones. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In June 2023 the committee travelled to Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne and Sydney to make site visits and engage in four of the six public hearings that were conducted. During the Adelaide site visits, we met with AUSMAP, who are a nationwide citizen science program that aims to quantify microplastic pollution, with the primary goals of identifying litter hotspots and assisting in source reduction. Separate from participating in the inquiry, AUSMAP were awarded a National Science Week grant in 2023 and took their passion on the road. Their first two events of National Science Week 2023 were held in Wollongong, with AUSMAP's research director, Dr Scott, and Juniper, their science officer, running an AUSMAP training day and community day, inspiring and engaging the local community. Sampling at a Belmore Basin beach site in my electorate saw rubber crumb fragments coming from local playgrounds, raising important conversations around the issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this report primarily reflects evidence dating from late 2022 into early 2023, the committee recognises this report does not encompass the full story of plastics pollution. Since the Senate Environment And Communications Reference Committee inquiry into the then-current research and understanding of plastic pollution reported in 2016, evidence documenting the extent and impact of plastic pollution has grown exponentially. Plastic undoubtedly plays a significant role in almost every area of life. It is the most prevalent of human-made products and is used across diverse sectors. It is lightweight, mouldable, durable, cheap to produce and performs critical functions, including within the medical industry and for food protection and preservation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, its environmental impact is now a source of great concern. The persistence of plastic in the environment after disposal has created a significant problem globally. Pertinently said by DCCEEW in their submission, plastics can leak into the terrestrial environment at various stages of their lifecycle and end up in our oceans. They can easily spread all over the world via air, natural and manmade waterways and oceans. From terrestrial environments, large river systems have been identified as the main pathways that spread plastics into our oceans, and plastic has been found in every corner of the earth. From the Arctic Ocean to the sea ice around Antarctica and in the deepest oceanic trench on earth, the Mariana Trench, estimated to be over 10,000 metres deep, there is plastic to be found.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Toothbrushes, bottle caps, cigarette lighters and other hard plastic items and fragments are found in the stomachs and remains of many marine species that have died slowly and painfully from starvation. The most common entanglement injuries to sea turtles, seabirds, whales and marine mammals occurred from discarded fishing gear or ghost nets, plastic bags, clothing, rope and sixpack rings, causing restricted mobility, scoliosis, starvation, smothering and wounding, which in turn leads to infections, amputation of limbs and death. While some microplastics are intentionally produced for use in consumer products, through weathering and wave action, larger pieces of plastic in the ocean can break down over time, becoming microplastics—fragments smaller than five millimetres in diameter. This means that plastic can enter the lower level of the food chain, consumed by smaller marine wildlife such as fish, crustaceans and plankton, and then in turn move up the food chain. Adding to the complexity of their environmental impact, plastics contain a diversity of chemical additives that can leach into the air, soil and water at every phase of the product's lifecycle. The current estimation of 150 million metric tonnes of waste plastic in the ocean is expected to quadruple by 2040, just 16 years away. If no action is taken, it is predicted that, in only 26 years' time, the amount of plastic in the ocean will outweigh fish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians consume plastic at three times the global average, and this rate continues to grow. Except for Singapore, Australia's consumption of single-use plastics per person is higher than in any other country in the world. This is not a new problem, but it is an enduring and insidious problem. It will not be solved overnight, but it cannot be ignored. We need to take decisive steps towards making a real difference now and into the future. The committee has therefore made 22 recommendations that emphasise collaboration, consistent national standards, bolstering existing schemes and developing new approaches, research and measures to mitigate the complexity of challenges we face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recommendations draw attention to challenges faced in remote areas of Australia and to engagement and collaboration with overseas institutions. The committee recommends that the Australian government, through DCCEEW and in consultation with state and territory governments, industry and the community, develop an updated National Plastics Plan. The updated plan, based on an overarching circular economy, should contain reporting and transparency measures to monitor progress and accountability and should be in place within 12 months of the tabling of this report. The department should report to parliament on the progress of key actions through its annual report. To be included in the plan, we recommend developing policies that track and limit polymer production in Australia, aim to reduce and enable visibility of the composition of imported plastics and, in collaboration with industry, strengthen product stewardship and the use of recycled content. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The department should also engage with industry to revise and strengthen the goals included in the 2025 National Packaging Targets. We recommend that the Australian government take a leadership role in coordinating and tracking the reduction of the use of plastics; harmonise, standardise and expand programs already in place, such as single-use plastic bans, the container deposit system and waste collection systems; standardise and simplify plastic packaging and labelling; and develop and fund a comprehensive and nationwide public awareness and education campaign that includes impacts and risks associated with microplastics. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Giving further regard to microplastics, the department should commission comprehensive research to determine the impacts of microplastics ingestion, inhalation and skin contact, including of absorbed toxins on humans, with the initial research to be made public in July 2026. Additionally, the government should engage with the environment ministers meeting to prioritise a national microplastic reduction strategy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a matter of urgency the Australian government should prioritise a sustainable end market for recovered plastics, considering incentives or mandates and including options for rural and remote areas. Additionally, the department should conduct a feasibility study into appropriate plastic disposal options for rural and regional areas, with the development of pilot programs by December 2025. In the development of any targeted solutions, the department should ensure that First Nations peoples are included, consulted and actively involved. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank those who brought to this inquiry their expertise, passion and time, through hearings and submissions, and the committee secretariat for their hard work. I commend the report to the Chamber.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  This shirt I'm wearing is made from Australian cotton. The cotton industry is an industry which has been demonised by many in this place. Cotton is a very good agricultural product, and Australian cotton growers do it better than any other nation on earth. But this shirt has a number of plastic buttons on it, and I've put in place plastic collar stays to make my ties sit better, and that's all well and good. But when the shirts come in the boxes, when these shirts are bought from stores, they contain so many pins and bits of plastic, around the collar, right through the sleeves, cuffs—the whole bit. It is unbelievable. And it's not just shirts. Just about every product we buy now comes wrapped in plastic, with so much material around it. It's not just to safeguard people from whatever condition the makers might think is going to befall customers when they open products. It's just nonsense. What we're seeing is a deluge of plastic being forced upon a society that puts consumerism above all else. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Energy, Environment and Water concluded its inquiry into plastic pollution in Australia's oceans and waterways earlier this year. It tabled a report on 28 May. The final report, which was tabled in parliament on that day, made 22 recommendations aimed at strengthening Australia's plastics management framework to minimise plastic waste to landfill, incentivise the use of recycled materials in the productions of new plastics, and strengthen the management of the plastics already in the environment. The chair of the committee was the member for Makin, and I very much agree with the comments he made at the time. I think any person who is concerned not just about the here and now but, indeed, about the future of our planet would also agree with much of what the member for Makin said. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Without urgent action, plastic waste will increase and continue to negatively impact our oceans and waterways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He continued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia needs to act now to protect its natural environment for future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He is right, of course. He is absolutely correct. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am the shadow minister for international development and the Pacific and I've gone to the Pacific on a number of occasions in my shadow portfolio work. One of the big issues in the Pacific is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. This whirlpool of pollution is larger than many European countries, and what a sad reality that is! As the member for Cunningham has just said, the ocean contains pollution in its deepest parts. Indeed, it is even in the Mariana Trench, which she mentioned, and elsewhere, right throughout not just the Great Pacific Garbage Patch but our oceans and waterways and across the seven seas. There are plastics at the very bottom of our oceans, and if we are serious about climate change and about taking action to make sure that our planet is the best it can be in the future, then our oceans are going to play a huge, if not the largest, part in that. If we continue to pollute our oceans at the rate we are, then heaven help the planet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It might come as a surprise to know that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was first identified in the 1940s. That is quite incredible. The rubbish that we have been putting into our oceans has been going in there for decades, but the great garbage patch is getting larger and larger, and at a faster and faster rate, and that is of great concern because, if we don't do something about it and if we don't address, first of all, the amount of plastics that we are producing, then our oceans have no chance. It's things such as shirts and the products and packaging that we're putting out into society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is often maligned, unfairly, for the actions that we took on the environment and climate, but I will give a shout-out to the former environment minister, the current member for Farrer, for what she did in this respect. Even in April 2021 she was out there announcing an additional $100 million investment so Australia and our region could continue leading the world in managing our ocean habitats and coastal environments and contributing to the global task of reducing emissions. The media release put out on 23 April 2021 stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the world's only island continent, Australia has always understood that how we manage our oceans and coastal environments will determine the success or failure of our world's efforts to address climate change. That is why we have been leading the world in taking action in this important area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it is an important area because, as I stated, if we don't get it right with the oceans, then the planet has no chance whatsoever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not only good for the environment and not only the right thing to do; it's actually good for jobs. The number of young people I encounter these days who are environmental scientists who, with biodiversity, supporting the oceans, recycling and climate resilience—but particularly the oceans—in mind, care deeply about what we are doing and how we are doing it is quite remarkable. I know that there are many companies—I had one come in to see me this week, but there's also one building a huge facility in Parkes within my current Riverina electorate boundary—that will be converting waste to energy, and that is to be commended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This take-note motion on the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Energy, Environment and Water report handed down in May this year is important. As the member for Makin has said, many Australians want to recycle correctly but inconsistencies amongst states and territories have led consumers to believe certain items are recyclable or compostable when they are not. As he stated further, the committee recommends nationally harmonising single-use plastic bans, waste collection standards and the container deposit scheme. That is a big ask because I remember the pushback even in New South Wales when the container deposit system was put in place there. South Australia has had it for many, many years—</span>

                    </a>  I see the member for Boothby agreeing. If you have a bottle—I believe it's plastic or glass—you can get a 10 per cent, if not higher, refund on that. I remember, growing up as a kid, we had that system in place whereby you could get money back on your rubbish and other people's as well. Kids would go around football grounds and showgrounds et cetera; there was very little litter because kids would go around and collect it and refund it for lollies or whatever the case might be. These days, it seems kids are so well off that they don't have to do it; you don't see them carting around big bags and collecting all the bottles after a football game or an event in an open area like a concert et cetera.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important take-note motion because our waterways are too important to get wrong. I encourage and urge the committee and others to acknowledge the work the Morrison government in particular did in this area. I know Australia's strength and support for a global plastics treaty was something both the member for Farrer and then Prime Minister Morrison pushed. The Pacific declaration urges the international community to start work on a legally binding global agreement as soon as possible; that happened during our last term of government. Support for a plastic-pollution treaty has grown exponentially, from fewer than 70 countries, at the time we very much supported it and got behind it, to more than 110 nations. This is important. We have to get it right. Our oceans are too important not to get it right, and we also need to address one of the hugest climate issues—that is, what we do about landfill.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  Gender based violence is an epidemic in our country. Thirty-nine per cent of women have experienced violence since the age of 15. Thirty-one per cent of women have experienced physical violence and 22 per cent have experienced sexual violence. Twelve per cent of adults reported having seen domestic violence against their mothers when they were children. Women are more likely to experience violence from someone they know than from a stranger—35 per cent to 11 per cent. Twenty-five per cent of women have experienced violence, emotional abuse or financial abuse from a cohabiting partner since the age of 15. Women with disability are more likely to experience violence, with 50 per cent of women with an intellectual disability experiencing sexual violence. Fifty-three per cent of women have experienced sexual harassment. On average, one woman is killed every nine days by a current or former partner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the research group Counting Dead Women Australia, 64 women were killed in violent incidents in 2023. In 2021-22, 4,620 women aged 15 or over were hospitalised due to family and domestic violence. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are 31 times more likely to be hospitalised by family and domestic violence, with non-Indigenous men making up a significant portion of the perpetrators. Our Watch research shows that around 25 per cent of men in Australia say that they have used physical or sexual violence against women. Gendered violence against women is estimated to cost Australia $26 billion a year. Financial abuse is estimated to cost $10.9 billion, of which $5.7 billion is borne directly by the victims—those same women who turn up in homelessness shelters in their latter years. We talk a lot about family and domestic violence in this place, and they are some very sobering statistics. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2022 the government launched the National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children. This is a 10-year plan for state and Commonwealth governments that looks at prevention, early intervention, response, recovery and healing. In the last three budgets this government has invested $3.4 billion, states and territories fund services, not-for-profits and charities fundraise for services and still these statistics persist. And each statistic represents countless lives, real human beings, lives lost, suffering, fear and disadvantage. To say this is an epidemic is understating it. If any other cause of death and injury, not to mention cost to the taxpayer and the economy—if there were anything else causing this much damage to 51 per cent of the community, it would be an emergency. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's sometimes easy to think everyone knows this, everyone cares and everyone wants something done about it. In here we talk about this quite a lot. We hear the statistics. We meet the survivors and the families of those killed. But I know that every time I put something up on social media about women—it doesn't even have to be about violence against women—I need to keep a sharp eye out for the trolls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do wonder if maybe the language we use is wrong, as we know the term 'just a domestic' used to be used to minimise what was happening behind closed doors to clearly align that this was a private matter. Maybe using terms like 'domestic violence' also minimises what is happening. Maybe, if we refer to what's happening as murder, assault and torture, it might get through the seriousness of what is happening to a very significant part of the Australian population, because the definition of the word 'domestic' relates to the running of a home or to family relations, and the only relevance here is that some of it happens in a domestic setting. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to finish by dedicating this speech to the late Helen Oxenham OAM. Helen Oxenham was a stalwart of the women's movement in South Australia. She grew up in a violent household in Ireland, one of six children, where her mother experienced violence and the children saw it. After migrating to Adelaide with her husband and hearing the stories of her friends going through similar violence with no supports, no services, she was instrumental in setting up the first women's shelter, in Christies Beach, in 1977. She sold lamingtons to fundraise to support this. Helen spent her entire life campaigning against domestic violence and promoting gender equity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She died recently, at age 93, and her Irish funeral and wake were attended by hundreds of mourners, from women that she had helped over the decades and their now adult children to leaders in the gender equality movement and in the anti-domestic-violence movement, local community groups, politicians and community leaders. Vale, Helen, and thank you for all you did. You made a difference to so many lives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0F" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOOD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I rise to speak on this very important statement on ending gender based violence. The sad reality is, when you look at the figures for family violence—and it sounds awful to use the words 'family violence'—they are going up all the time. But in some ways things have changed. I go back to my time in the Victorian police force. A lot of times, when I was at Boronia criminal investigations branch, there would a violent domestic and, sadly, it was always the woman who would end up being badly beaten, in some cases raped. It was all about control. I remember one time in particular, one of the saddest cases we had, where a lady was badly, badly beaten. We put the brief together to go into the County Court to charge the husband. Then she came in a month later to withdraw the charges against him. In the background, the husband was just kind of giving us a wink. That's what happened in those days. The police wouldn't actually push a case unless we had a victim. When it comes to family violence, it has changed for the better over time, and the courts actually take action on what the police present, even though you can have a reluctant victim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just talk about the La Trobe stats. Sadly, La Trobe, in the south-east of Victoria, hit the media for the wrong reasons recently, when it came to Cardinia Shire crime stats. The family violence rate is up 7.3 per cent compared to the previous year. Amazingly, 1,669 incidents were recorded up to March 2024. The government promised an additional 500 frontline workers, and they were meant to have delivered 352 of the 500 workers by now. The government haven't met that target. They must meet that target, but 136 is all they have at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community legal centres are so important. I've had a lot of dealings with the Narre Warren community legal service and I know the support they provide to women. I want to really focus on migrant women, because that's the No. 1 issue when it comes to my office, and I'm also the shadow minister for multicultural affairs. I will talk about an incident that happened not long ago. The Victoria Police do a fantastic job. They arrested a person who was threatening to have his wife deported back to another country—I won't say the country. She had the courage to call Victoria Police. They came and arrested him, and my office have been dealing with this lady. We found out what he had actually been doing, and this is something I've written to the Victorian chief commissioner about. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We find, when it comes to multicultural communities, that if a person hasn't been in Australia for a number of years, they don't understand the court process. In this case, the person had been here for a number of years but she had no idea. She had been totally isolated by the husband. When it came to her permanent residency, the husband would get all the emails from Immigration but never applied for permanent residency and wouldn't allow her to get a drivers licence. He said, 'You don't need to work.' If she went out anywhere, she'd be bombarded by SMSs and calls asking, 'Where are you?' It was what we call coercive control. When the police took the offender, the husband, to court, he was locked up for two weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem was, when it came to the victim, she didn't have any understanding of the court process at all. She thought she had to get a legal representative to take her husband to court and defend herself. That's when we had to go and explain what was occurring. I've suggested to Victoria Police that they take a proactive stance when it comes to court proceedings. I've made two points. In cases of breaches of intervention orders, it is important for the victims to understand that the police act as the prosecutor. It's not a requirement for the victim to actually get a lawyer. The aggrieved member does not necessarily need to engage a lawyer. And it would be prudent for the police to maintain regular contact with victims, perhaps every two weeks. While this may be time consuming, it would provide much-needed support to the victims, who often feel isolated. So I'm looking forward to Victoria Police's response to this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a big issue. Family and domestic violence does not just affect one community group; it affects the entire country. It doesn't matter where you were born, Australia or overseas; family violence is absolutely devastating, particularly the murders. One in four women have experienced family violence by an intimate partner from the age of 15, which is an absolute tragedy. When it comes to murders, what has taken place over the years has been absolutely horrific. I think one woman gets murdered every six days. When I spoke previously to the homicide squad in Victoria, I asked if there was a common denominator when it comes to these murders. They said that it is all about control and winning the argument—that the offender is not thinking about jail or consequences; they just must win it at all costs. This is an absolutely awful situation. I seek leave to table the letter to the Victorian chief commissioner of police, which I mentioned earlier.</span>

                  <a href="E0F" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr WOOD:</span>
                  </a>  When it comes to our plan, something that the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has been very passionate about is doubling the size of the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation. Child exploitation is such a tragic thing. Again, to go back to my days in the police force, every Monday morning, as a detective, you'd come in to the Boronia criminal investigations branch, and sadly there would be a young person, usually female, who had been abused over the weekend at a sleepover.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I'm very passionate about is a national child sex disclosure scheme. We did research with Dr Rick Brown from the Australian Institute of Criminology, where we found out that when it comes to recidivist offenders—and I think 1,700 had actually reoffended—those they targeted were, on average, 11-year-old girls. The most interesting and saddest fact was that when a recidivist offender commits their crime it's normally within the timespan of, say, 10 years, during which time the victims may have grown up or the offender has gone interstate and goes to a new area, and then he would swap his target, from, say, male to female. It's predatory behaviour, as described to me by Dr Rick Brown. So that's something I'm very passionate about. I don't know why we still haven't got a national child sex offender register. That's something I'll continue to push hard for. It's so important to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, we on this side will be extending emergency payments to support women and children fleeing domestic violence, which we established back in 2021, and introducing tougher bail laws for Commonwealth offences. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To finish off, I want to speak about migrant women who may have come from a country where they don't trust law enforcement authorities and who may have language and cultural barriers, face isolation from families and support networks, and have a lack awareness of available services. It is very important for Home Affairs to make sure that when these women arrive in Australia they are provided with this information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing this side wanted to do is change the character test, so that if a person who is here on a visa commits family violence then their visa would be revoked and they would be deported. Sadly, the government didn't support that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other one I'm very keen on is what I call women's friendship cafes. I remember going to WASEMA, the Women's Association South East Melbourne Australia, where women would come together from multicultural communities to discuss issues of family violence and support. The other thing that is so important when it comes to coercive powers is that the husband will stop his wife from going to a cafe, a restaurant, a gym, or anything else but will allow her to go to the school to drop off the kids, and that's where these cafes are most effective in supporting women. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00ATG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:49</span>):  I think a lot of Australians sometimes think that our political system is broken and that not very much happens in parliament. They get sick of the to-and-fro. We have an adversarial system in our parliament. But I want to say to Australians listening to this debate that, on the issue of gendered violence, the whole parliament does think it is important. From listening to the excellent contributions so far, I think every member of parliament knows that we've got to do better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We wake too often to a story of another woman having been murdered by someone who said they loved them. Enough is enough is enough. We cannot become immune to this tragedy or shrug our shoulders and say, 'Well, this is the way things are.' Family violence, violence against women and children, does not distinguish between the suburb you live in, what school you went to, how much money you have in the bank account, what ethnicity you are or what part of Australia you live in. The data shows that 2.2 million Australians have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from their partners, and it says that 3.6 million Australians have experience emotional abuse from a partner—and, let's be honest, that's just the people who are willing to say they experienced emotional abuse. Then you've got the kids who have to live with the trauma of abuse. That's a little bit about what I'm going to talk about today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Men can experience violence like women can. Most blokes are simply not violent, but the research is clear that there's a gendered pattern. Women and their kids are disproportionately, hugely, the victims. Women are much more likely than men to experience sexual and emotional violence from an intimate partner. I'm afraid the numbers don't lie—although I want to move beyond the numbers. It is terrible that one in six of our sisters, mothers, daughters and fellow Australian women have experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner since the age of 15. I think it's about one in 18 men. One in four women have reported experiencing emotional abuse by an intimate partner since the age of 15, and those are the ones who report it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gendered violence is not new in this country. We're better at talking about it, and we're better at measuring some of it, but I know that for a lot of our colleagues in the parliament and also, perhaps, a lot of adults listening to parliament today—think back to your school days. There might have been a kid who turned up with bruises they didn't want to talk about. Perhaps there was the weird kid who no-one picked for the team, who would sit in the corner and who didn't seem to have much lunch. Perhaps there were the kids who you would talk to at school but who would make every excuse not to have their friends come to their house. I think the signs have been there for generations, but the awareness and the willingness to go hard against the issue hasn't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that tonight there'll be too many children living in dysfunctional homes. There will be kids tonight who might even come home from secondary school or uni, and their mum will have the light on or off on the porch, and that will be a signal to say if dad is in a good mood or not. Your home shouldn't be where you feel that you've got to walk on eggshells, as if you're negotiating a minefield. I know that tonight there'll be so many households where there'll be mitigation strategies in place to try and appease anger and aggro.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also understand that some of the men who do these heinous things can be great blokes in the workplace and can be friendly neighbours—street angel, home devil. I get that, for men who perpetrate violence against women, there could be reasons. They could be in the grip of alcoholism—or an alcoholism accelerant—drugs or gambling. Maybe their own childhood was terrible and they didn't have good role models, and that trauma of their childhood just replicates. These things may explain it but they cannot excuse it. They're committing crimes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is so difficult, though, is there will be women with a desire to escape violence but overwhelmed by the need to stay. It could be financial. It could be the need to protect the kids. It could be the uncertainty of fear of the change. Or it could be they are worried about angering the perpetrator even more.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SHORTEN:</span>
                  </a>  These men are committing crimes, and women have reasons why they can't flee. We know it's a crisis. Successive governments have started to tackle it. We're investing $925 million over five years. It builds on record measures of the current government to address violence against women: the 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave; the largest increase in rent assistance in 30 years; and investment in crisis accommodation and affordable housing for women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Minister for Government Services, I can't solve the gendered violence crisis but I'm going to break down the silos within and across government so women who confront questions about whether to stay or go can find their decision easier. I've asked my public servants to work towards the idea of joined-up services, so if a woman is fleeing a violent partner she can have on her card a curated and ready-to-use system, her phone can prove who she is and immediately connect her with a dedicated social worker, she can commence a crisis payment and find suitable accommodation and, if she chooses to apply for an AVO, she can be connected to law enforcement to commence the process. We need to break down the plague of fiefdoms in our Public Service because if we can have a simple identification which gives a woman the freedom to exercise choice then perhaps we'll save more lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really want to finish my contribution by saying that gendered violence is a man's issue. It is men who, by and large, are the problem. Men learn from the trauma of their own childhood, and some repeat it. It's interesting why men who had abuse in their own childhood turn out to be good fathers and husbands. I think that, if they don't repeat it, it's often because of the influence of strong mothers and other women in their lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Young boys tonight will learn about violence. Young girls will learn. But if the young boys who learn about it don't have the right role models—the good men to guide them—then that violence will be intergenerational. We shouldn't kid ourselves. There will be beautiful 12-year-old kids tonight wondering if they will win or lose in their dad's mood lottery. They know their dad's not always a bad fella. He might have undiagnosed depression. He might have had trauma in his childhood. He could just be frustrated that life has turned out the way it has. He could love the drink too much. But that doesn't excuse the violence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are kids tonight in Australia who will have too few good memories of their childhood. Perhaps there was one trip to the beach or one attempt to teach them how to ride a bike. Perhaps they'll have the embarrassment of their father falling asleep, drunk, at the school prize night. We know that alcohol is an accelerant of violence. Gambling can be. For goodness sake, sometimes some men even use the excuse of a losing football team. That is weak and pathetic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aussie children shouldn't have to develop coping and survival strategies. They shouldn't have to turn up their air pods louder or put headphones on. They shouldn't have to hope that Dad falls asleep quickly at the table. They shouldn't have to hear their mother fighting to protect them from their father. Children should not have to learn to disassociate the world they live in outside the house and the times that their aggressive father comes home. I know tonight there will be many Australian mothers who will be shields for their children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to educate our young boys to respect women, but we have to break the intergenerational trauma. We must encourage men to examine their own childhoods and deal with the trauma. We've got to also teach people that the toxic masculinity of the Tates, the Rogans and the Petersons of the online world is not the real world. It is alarming in the digital age that 25 per cent of teenage boys look up to social media personalities that perpetuate stupid, old-fashioned, violent attitudes. We're funding a three-year trial to see how we can change this. My colleague Amanda Rishworth has announced the healthy masculinities project trial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, I'm asking men in Australia to step up. I can't change what happened in your childhood, but you can be the father to your kids that you always deserved but perhaps never had.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:03</span>):  I'm pleased to rise to speak on stopping gender based violence—or domestic violence, as we know it. The first thing I would like to say is that everyone in this place has the same intention, and that is to rid our society of domestic violence. And this should be bipartisan. The speeches that I've heard today are wonderful speeches with wonderful intentions. I will never criticise anybody across the floor or across parties on this, because we have all tried and we have all failed and we continue to fail, but our intent is there. We want to help. We just need to get the right measures in place. So it is very pleasing, what we did in government in the last few terms and what this government is doing—taking steps in the right direction towards reducing gender based violence, or domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very privileged to be in this place, but I think I'm even more privileged to have the role of shadow assistant minister for the prevention of family violence. It is something that I am extremely passionate about. I've travelled around Australia, talking to victim advocates, survivor advocates, agencies and police. I have been to every state and territory, in the cities, the regions and the very remote areas, talking to those people who are on the front line or who provide those services. One thing I can say is that every single agency—every single person—is stretched beyond imagination. They are overwhelmed by the amount of domestic violence in their communities, but they're also overwhelmed by the lack of resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see—and credit to the government—$3.4 billion in this budget going towards the national prevention plan, but, of that, 17 per cent is for prevention and intervention, which means that 83 per cent is for response and recovery. That has been described by all the agencies and all the people that I've spoken to as the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. We are not addressing the causal problem. Putting 17 per cent into prevention and intervention is not going to change anything. We are just going to keep going around and around, watching the same things happen over and over again. I am not suggesting for one moment that we should not be funding those crucial agencies and those crucial services. What I'm saying is that we should be matching, dollar for dollar, funding for prevention and intervention and funding for response and recovery, otherwise we'll be standing here in another decade saying that domestic violence is still a blight on our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first step in changing this cycle is funding those agencies and putting the money there for the programs that are required to change society and to change the way we think. It was very pleasing to read the report that came out from the Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commissioner, Micaela Cronin. In the key findings on page 13, the commissioner talks about engaging men:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Men must be a part of every aspect of ending violence. Governments must support efforts to redefine masculinity and engage men effectively. More intervention options for men using or at risk of using violence are needed, which take a trauma-informed approach, improve information sharing and risk assessment and management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is really pleasing to hear the change in the conversation and the change in attitude. Men are the problem, but men are also the solution. We have now recognised that reality. As we know, eight out of 10 offences are committed by men. Yes, they may be coming from a place of trauma and, yes, they need to be punished, but there need to be those programs and those supports to change the thinking—not just changing the thinking of male offenders but having those programs out there for men's mental health and wellbeing.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard a figure yesterday. In the budget, women's health receives $187 million a year. Men's health? $7 million. Men's health gets $7 million a year, compared with $187 million for women's health. I'm absolutely committed to women's health, and, yes, it should receive the funding. But why is there that disparity for men's health? A healthy male is a healthy father and a healthy member of the community. That just doesn't come down to physical health, but it also comes down to mental health. We know that mental health contributes to this vile situation of domestic violence. We need to change that. We need to fund men's mental health. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with Movember last week—and congratulations, again, to the government for their partnership with Movember. It's a great step forward, because they work with men, and they create men's programs to make healthy males. We've heard about young men turning toward social media and toxic masculinity looking for answers. Well, flip the coin, and Movember is there to help our young men, and to help our men be good members of the community. But we also need to put in place a generational curriculum in our education system. It's not just outside. It's not just 'Let's deal with men'. Let's change the way we look at things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was privileged to speak with the education minister for Indonesia, Nadiem Makarim. Minister Makarim was a tech billionaire by the time he was 30. He was tapped on the shoulder by the president, who said to him, 'I want you to be my education minister.' What the minister did was put into the national curriculum, alongside maths, English, reading, writing, 'respect and respectful relationships'. It is a holistic program. It's about not just how to treat women, but how to treat each other—how to be a better member of society, and what is expected. Within two short years, not only had incidents of chauvinism and assault decreased significantly, but academic excellence had gone through the roof.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what we need to do here. We need to have a national curriculum and education system which incorporates this; not just one day a year. Those programs like Love Bites are fantastic programs, but it has to be like maths and English where you have it a couple of times a week and you get tested on it, just like they do in Indonesia. It also needs to go on a journey from kindergarten through to year 12 with that child. It's irrelevant whether that child is male or female. That's exactly what we need to do. Until we implement those things, change the funding modelling, change the conversation in society, change the education system and bring men into the room, we will continue to go on this roundabout. We will continue with same old, same old since time immemorial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this is something we should be on the same page on. I am always happy to talk to my counterpart across the floor to work with the government to improve the systems, and, hopefully, in a generation's time we won't be having this conversation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:13</span>):  That was a fine contribution from the member for Cowper. As we know, he is the shadow assistant minister for the prevention of family violence and he is working to end the scourge of gender based violence. Having been a police officer, he would have seen far too many sad examples of domestic violence in his line of work. He followed the member for Maribyrnong, a former opposition leader, who also made a sterling speech in this debate. That's actually an ill-named word for this, because it is not a debate. It's a discussion about what we could, should and must do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we also heard from the member for La Trobe, who is also very much involved in law enforcement, as well as the member for Boothby. They were all very good contributions. This parliament is always best when we are on the same page. When it comes to combating gender based violence, we certainly are as one. There is much to do, not just at a federal level but indeed at state and local government levels as well. As communities, families and individuals, much more must be done. The incidence of gender based violence, which leads to unspeakable deaths, is just so, so tragic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even in my own Riverina electorate, Molly Jean Ticehurst died at the hands of an alleged perpetrator who was a former intimate partner on 22 April this year. She was the loving mother of a little boy, Nate, who will grow up not knowing the love, comfort and support—the unbreakable bond—of a mother and son. He will not have that. That is so, so sad. I know that members of her family and wider circle of friends are seeking a wellness hub for women, which would be a one-stop shop. It's probably another misnomer to call it a shop, but it would be a refuge and somewhere women could go in Forbes, in Central-Western New South Wales and the Riverina electorate. I know the mayor, Phyllis Miller, who is a marvellous person and has advocated also for a 24/7 policing presence in that town. No-one knows whether that would have avoided the circumstance of tragedy that befell poor Molly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I tell you what—at her funeral, it was said that people believed she would one day change the world and move the nation. She shouldn't have had to do it in this way. Many people were so moved by her loss and the grief which poured out at her funeral at that football field. It was immense. It was immeasurable. Premier Chris Minns, who had a tragedy in his own family, having lost his dad just the day before, attended the funeral, and I commend him for the leadership he showed in doing just that. But it's not just Molly, and it's not just this year. This has been going on for too long. After the death of Hannah Clarke, we all remember the scenes in that suburban street in Brisbane, Camp Hill, where Hannah and her three beautiful children, Aaliyah, just six, Laianah, only four, and little Trey, three, all lost their lives. Hannah was only 33. Her life was extinguished by her former husband. Their loss creates grief beyond comprehension. We should turn these tragedies into action nationally and in our own homes and communities to do something about this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Wagga Wagga recently, the Wagga Women's Health Centre, which has been operating since the 1970s, had what they called Australia's first men's leadership forum on domestic and family violence. I have to say that, at the rally which followed Molly's passing, held in Wagga Wagga in the Victory Memorial Gardens, the most outstanding speech on that day was by Johanna Elms. There's not much of Johanna; she's a pocket dynamo. She spoke so passionately about what we needed to do to end gender based domestic violence and how we could do it. It was Johanna and her cohort at the Wagga Women's Health Centre who came up with the idea of a men's leadership forum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just under 100 men turned up—and it was only men; there were no women—to the Wild Vine at Oura on Friday 26 July. There were no women there at all. We had, as speaker, Adam Blanch, a psychologist for 40 years with a special interest in the fields of trauma, the psychology of interpersonal violence and the psychology of identity. We heard from Rhys Cummins, a Wagga Wagga local and founder of the Murrumbidgee Men's Group. He works for Pathways Murrumbidgee in the drug and alcohol field. He is an exceptional spokesperson for men's mental health in the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard from Dave Kramer. Dave is a behavioural scientist dedicated to empowering individuals to create safe, equitable and inclusive homes, workplaces, schools and communities. More importantly, perhaps, he was a friend of Hannah Clarke's. He hardly kept it together as he related stories of Hannah's children, because he was very close to the family. I spoke to him afterwards and told him of my admiration for the work that he is doing. He is making it his lifelong passion to do what he can not only to respect Hannah's memory to a national audience but to make that national audience sit up and listen when he speaks about the need to end gender-based domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Cowper said, we can and we must do more. As the member for Maribyrnong quite correctly pointed out, it's up to men to lift their game, do better, and, quite frankly, take ownership of and responsibility for this scourge on society. The women's health centre has put out quotes from the men who attended the forum in Wagga Wagga. Those men said that it was such an eye-opener. They said that people needed to start believing victims. They also said that no community was immune from this, but that, as communities, we all need to make sure we speak up about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can remember that one of my very first jobs when I ran a media agency was to help the women's health centre with the No More Silence Against Domestic Violence campaign. It was as true back then in the early 2000s as it is now. But wouldn't it be wonderful if we had a society where, yes, we could have an open discussion about these issues but that discussion would be all in the past tense? It would be a discussion in which you could say, 'Back then.' But it's not 'back then'; it is now and it is in the future. We must very much lift our game, and it starts with men. We need to talk about mental health. We need to talk about how we can better deal with these situations so that there are no future Molly Ticehursts and Hannah Clarkes, women can live free in the knowledge that they can go for a run or a walk without having to look over their shoulders and worry about whether they're going to be attacked, they can live free in their own homes without coercive control and they can live lives that we men get to enjoy without even having to think about it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300127" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WATSON-BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  Yesterday the Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commissioner tabled her inaugural report to parliament, designed to measure progress and impact of the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children. The commissioner warned that the women's safety sector is already buckling under huge pressure and that, when there's an increase in reporting, frontline services need more support to meet increased demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an epidemic of men's violence against women, and our frontline services are doing the very best they can in a system that continues to tell them to do more with less. For the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children to succeed, it needs to be properly funded. We need to be clear here: the true cost of not funding this plan will be women's safety—their lives and their children's lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The women's safety sector has said for a decade that it needs $1 billion each year to be able to help everyone who reaches out for help, rather than having to turn people away back to situations of violence. So far, Labor has committed less than two-thirds of this amount. I want the government to recognise the horror that this poor system is inflicting not only on those making the brave decision to flee violence but on the staff who have dedicated their lives to helping the most vulnerable. It's traumatising and it could be avoided if Labor provided the funds required for the national plan to actually succeed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor continue to ignore the calls for more funding, they risk squandering another decade and more women's lives. Already this year, devastatingly, 45 women have been killed by violence—45. We know this number because of the brave work of volunteer organisation Counting Dead Women Australia and their research through Destroy the Joint. The government doesn't even keep a national family and domestic violence death toll. The Greens have been pushing for years for the government to keep an FDV death toll. We need this important data to aid in awareness raising and prevention; yet this work is being done by volunteers. How many more women have to die for the government to actually do something useful about it? What's the price that women have to pay? For many, sadly, it's the ultimate price. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's another cruel fact. First Nations women are 33 times more likely to be hospitalised as a result of violence and six times more likely to be killed; yet we know that First Nations women are overpoliced and undersupported. Our so-called justice system is weaponised against them. They experience systemic racism, victim blaming and very poor police responses. This government needs to do better for our First Nations women and children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that women on low wages or on income support are especially vulnerable, without the resources to escape violent situations. Yet this government persists with the cruelty of keeping income support payments like JobSeeker below the poverty line and has the audacity to cry poor while dishing out hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts and handouts for the rich. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The housing crisis is felt even more acutely by women and children experiencing family and domestic violence. Women are forced to choose between abuse and homelessness because there's just nowhere for them to go. Let's be clear: our social security system is built on shame and humiliation, demonising those who need these supports. It's absolutely a further barrier for people escaping violence. The government could have solved this if they had worked with the Greens on their housing plan. We can scrap negative gearing and capital gains tax handouts, build more houses and put a freeze and a cap on rents to make housing affordable so that people don't have to choose between abuse and homelessness. They could invest the money they make from scrapping tax handouts to wealthy property developers directly into crisis accommodation or funding the absolutely critical services our frontline workers provide to people escaping violence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Labor government continues to underfund frontline family, domestic and sexual violence services, victim-survivors are turned away from crisis accommodation and one woman is murdered every four days in this country. This issue should be above politics—and we've heard some very fine and heartfelt words from the speakers here today. It is well past time the Albanese government fully funded the organisations that actually do the hard work on the front line of this dreadful epidemic. Anything less is a betrayal to women. The more Labor ignores this crisis, the more women will die.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I love being a mum. I feel lucky every day I have the opportunity to watch my kids grow. I also feel lucky that when my children were small I had a network of mum friends with whom to share the ups and downs of being a new parent—friends who were with me in the trenches of newborns and toddlers and who knew the worry and guilt that sometimes comes with figuring out how to be a mum. I still have and treasure these friendships, and we still share parenting stories, but the worries about our children have changed. We're increasingly concerned about the state of the world we're leaving for our children, and, importantly, how the world around us is affecting our kids' mental health. This job has shown me it's not just mums who are concerned; since being elected I've been inundated with calls and emails and meetings with parents in Curtin who are worried about their kids' mental health and are desperate to find out what they can do to help them access services and what can be done to address the causes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lancet psychiatry commission on youth mental health</span> was published, the product of a team of 50 leading psychiatrists, psychologists, academics and young people. It was reported in the media, with headlines declaring 'Youth mental health is a global crisis' and 'Youth mental health in a dangerous phase of decline'. The report, led by Professor Patrick McGorry, of Orygen, showed that over the last 15 to 20 years there has been a 50 per cent increase in the need for mental health care for young people. In Australia two out of five young people and almost one in two young women are affected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission looked at the global contributors to this increase, which included intergenerational inequality, unregulated social media, insecurity of employment and climate change. The statistics in the report are horrifying. Globally, mental disorders are the leading causes of disability among young people. Suicide is the leading cause of death among people aged 15 to 44 in Australia. But even when these illnesses do not cause death or disability they're the most rapidly growing cause of lost human potential and productivity across the life span. Professor McGorry said, 'This is the most serious public health problem we've got.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alarmingly, of the young Australians that have a diagnosable and treatable condition, only 50 per cent of people with mental illness are getting access to care. Young people are falling through the cracks because they're too unwell, not unwell enough or the wrong age, or because medical services are fully booked, or because of a lack of appropriate models of care. I know that in my electorate it's almost impossible to access a child psychologist, with 12-month waiting lists to see a paediatric psychiatrist. For an electorate that has one of the best medical and hospital precincts in the state, this seems outrageous. The services our kids need are just not available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the findings of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lancet</span> report was that mental health services are desperately underfunded. Mental health issues account for 45 per cent of the disease burden for 10- to 24-year-olds worldwide but only two per cent of health budgets globally. I've discussed this with my youth advisory group, a group of year 11 students who represent their schools and let me know what matters for young people in Curtin and what they're worried about. Last year one of the students wisely said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We need to recognise that mental health challenges are not a personal failing, but a societal issue. Young people are facing an unprecedented level of stress and pressure, from social media to academic expectations, to family and community dynamics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reform is desperately needed so that we can support our children when they need it. We need to increase community awareness and education, especially about prevention and the social and economic determinants of mental health. We need soft entry to care that's rapid, easy and affordable, and which is youth friendly and stigma free. We need strong connections between mental health providers and schools. We need to integrate digital support across all stages of care as well as before entry to face-to-face care. Crucially, we need to make sure that youth specific care is reflective of the needs associated with the life stage of emerging adulthood. Care must be private and confidential, but support systems like family, education and employment must be engaged and supported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has committed to a review of youth mental health services, but I'm worried we're doing too little, too late. I really hope that reports like that from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lancet</span><span style="font-style:italic;">psychiatry</span> commission will inform a substantial significant response from government, with funding commensurate to the problem. Our kids need us to act now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  We've returned to parliament after the winter break, with every Australian taxpayer having received a tax cut—and that's every taxpayer in my community. The government have been focused again on our priority around cost-of-living relief, as well as continuing our legislative agenda to tackle the big issues and the big things that we as a country have to get to work on. One of those this fortnight has been the Future Made in Australia legislation brought into the parliament. We want Australia to have more economic security. The Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, introduced into the parliament an important plan that will see us investing in a future made in Australia. The plan will bring new jobs and opportunities to communities across the country. Our plan will make Australia a renewable energy powerhouse. It will maximise the economic and industrial benefits of the international move to net zero and secure Australia's place in a changing global economic and strategic landscape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's news on renewables, with the Minister for the Environment and Water, Tanya Plibersek, having just approved Australia's biggest renewable energy project ever that will create 7,000 jobs. SunCable's Australia-Asia power link solar farm will generate enough energy to power three million Australian homes, generating almost six times the amount of energy a large nuclear reactor could deliver. The Albanese government is getting on with building cheaper, cleaner and renewable energy. We've now approved enough renewable energy to power seven million homes. We have also approved a new wind farm in Victoria's north-west that will power 202,000 Victorian homes and help make power bills cheaper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been National Skills Week while we've been here, and I'm so proud that as a government we've helped more than half a million Australians enrol in fee-free TAFE, delivering cost-of-living relief for students and helping Australians get better paid jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also got legislation in the parliament this week to wipe $3 billion in student debt for three million young Australians. This will help many students and young people with the increasing pressures of the cost of living and their growing HECS debts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a big fortnight for gender equality. The Albanese government is focused on taking action on gender equality. This week we learned the good news that the gender pay gap is at an historic low of 11.5 per cent. Women's average weekly earnings have increased by $173 a week since we took office in 2022, and this is not an accident. This is about supporting the Fair Work Commission to raise wages for our lowest paid. It's about a 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers and a 15 per cent pay rise for early education and childcare workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning, Minister Rishworth introduced the most recent piece of paid parental leave legislation. This is critical for working families, and the bill will put superannuation on paid parental leave. This is an enormous change and means that families will end up with more superannuation for their later life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also had legislation to ban non-consensual sexually explicit deepfake content this week. This is important, particularly in our community in the west of Melbourne, as this has seen us in the headlines recently. Sharing deepfake sexually explicit material is a damaging form of abuse that overwhelmingly targets women and girls and inflicts deep harm on victims. We have zero tolerance for it and have introduced legislation to ban it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence, Justine Elliot, delivered a powerful statement in parliament yesterday outlining how our government has made it a priority to end violence against women and children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week has also seen the anniversary of the Julia Gillard government, on 21 August 2010, something I know that those at home are celebrating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We started this fortnight with the Olympics finishing and with celebrations in the private member's motion in the chamber, where some here joined me in congratulating our medallists and all of our competitors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week I also got to meet with Victorian education minister Ben Carroll while he was in Canberra to talk about our local schools, and, as an educator, I was keen to have some time face to face with Ben to explain to him some of the needs in the local schools in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a fantastic fortnight here in Canberra. I'm looking forward to being home for a couple of weeks and then coming back to get on with the legislative agenda beyond that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282237" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ARCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  I rise today to speak on the critical work that's undertaken across the country by community legal centres and the urgent need to address desperate funding shortfalls. There are 166 organisations across the country in the community legal centre membership, working in communities across the country and providing free information, resources, assistance and representation to avoid and resolve legal problems. These organisations receive funding through the National Legal Assistance Partnership, NLAP. The current agreement expires in less than a year and negotiations between the Commonwealth, states and territories are now taking place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sector is urgently calling on all parties to commit to both urgent funding this year and increased base funding ongoing. Centres are experiencing increasing demand for services, seeing hundreds of thousands of people each year, but as Tim Leach of Community Legal Centres Australia said at an event in parliament this week, 'We are having to turn away double the number of people we're able to see, and that is a national crisis.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These services are on the frontline in our communities, dealing with issues such as family violence, family law, financial security, safe and secure housing, and discrimination. They deliver an invaluable service to some of the most vulnerable people in our community, but they operate beyond the limits of their capacity. I frequently hear from constituents who are unable to access support because the services are overloaded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the challenges, centres have tried to innovate and introduce services to provide education and other programs. In April 2011, in my community, the Launceston Community Legal Centre launched an innovative program to improve legal literacy in the community. The Legal Literacy Volunteer Program trains volunteers to provide regular outreach support in accessible community settings like neighbourhood houses, with the aim of helping people resolve non-legal issues like completing forms required by Centrelink and other government agencies, and reading and understanding documents. This relieves some of the pressure on the legal service provision by helping with straightforward tasks which might otherwise fall to one of the centre's lawyers. It also helps people resolve problems early, often before circumstances can escalate or worsen, thereby avoiding the need for legal support in the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women's Legal Service also recognises this challenge in noting the benefits of health justice partnerships, saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… One in five of the most disadvantaged in our community take no action in response to their legal problems for a range of reasons including stress, time, cost, fear or not realising it is a legal problem … </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Living in regional and remote areas is also a barrier. When people do seek help, they are more likely to ask a trusted non-legal professional such as a health or community service provider, leading women's legal and legal aid to embed free legal help into health and social service settings, such as child and family centres, with the aim of reducing family violence for Tasmanians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Legal Literacy Volunteer Program is evidence based. Importantly, volunteers collect data as part of the reporting processes, which provide necessary information for analysing community needs and measuring the effectiveness of the program. The program has been extremely successful, but the centre has faced an ongoing funding issues challenge through the COVID-19 pandemic. The program, which is not funded under the NLAP agreement, lost state funding for 18 months, resulting in positions being lost and a lot of time and work to re-establish the program. Having now re-established the program, the centre has highlighted it during the recent NLAP review as a cost-effective model of legal problem prevention and early intervention. The centre hopes the NLAP review will result in increased base level funding so that centres can operate innovative programs like this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These sorts of programs should be encouraged and amplified right across the country, but that is simply not possible without additional ongoing reliable funding. Investing in the core services offered by community legal services is vital to ensure workforce stabilisation and to meet community demand. As the sector has stated, the Commonwealth government has a responsibility to provide community legal centres with consistent guaranteed baseline funding. People in communities experiencing disadvantage deserve to feel certain that the holistic trauma informed services they rely on will be accessible when and where they need them, now and into the future. I call on the government to urgently turn its attention to this crisis and commit to increasing support for this vital service.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Social Services and Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:44</span>):  I rise today to acknowledge the extraordinary work of Rotary clubs in my electorate. Today, I want to speak particularly about the Rotary Club of Ballina-on-Richmond. My good friend, the wonderful Dave Harmon, is a former governor of Rotary district 9640, of which Ballina branch is a member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, I hosted Dave and his wife Robyn, and members of the Ballina Rotary club and many other Rotary clubs, right here in parliament to launch their campaign: Rotary Says NO to Domestic Violence. This campaign, which originated in my electorate, is a tremendous example of a community led campaign that aims to increase the awareness of domestic violence in each and every neighbourhood, right across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since launching the campaign in November last year, Dave Harmon and the Ballina Rotary club have stopped at absolutely nothing to spread the word of their campaign. Rotary Ballina have encouraged businesses, community groups and sporting teams right across the electorate—everyone—to join in what they call Purple Shirt Friday. It's a great initiative. On Purple Shirt Friday individuals and businesses proudly wear a purple shirt with the powerful message: 'Say no to domestic violence.' These shirts have started hundreds if not thousands of life-changing conversations, proving that community led campaigns such as this can make a real difference. The impact is massive. Indeed, they were recognised earlier this year at the Ballina Shire Council Australia Day Awards, receiving the Community Event of the Year Award, a fantastic achievement for the work they're doing. Rotary Ballina has also created a toolkit to assist members in responding to domestic and family violence. The toolkit contains vital information, including contact details for specialist referral services, and toolkits have been received by more than 1,300 Rotarians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rotary Ballina hasn't stopped there. Over the past year, Dave Harmon has been meeting with a whole variety of organisations, governments and police services, including the New South Wales police and, most recently, the Queensland police to discuss establishing a memorandum of understanding. In very exciting news, just last week Dave informed me that Rotary and the New South Wales police have formalised a three-year partnership and the Queensland police will provide formal support for the Rotary Says No to Domestic Violence campaign. Due to the campaign's significant success, Dave also recently told me that the regional council of Rotary Zone 8, which Ballina club sits within, has committed to this campaign for the next three years. That's incredible dedication from these Rotary clubs. It is amazing, the extent to which they have reach, and it really speaks to Dave's activities and how truly inspiration he, his wife, Robyn, and the entire Rotary team at Ballina are, considering it was less than a year ago that it was launched.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence, I know full well the huge investment this government has made to eliminate violence against women and children in one generation. Our commitment is backed by an investment of more than $3.4 billion, but our government can't do this alone, as we've repeatedly said. We need businesses, community groups and all individuals to step up and work with us to make this vital change right throughout the nation. That's why I'm really proud to have in my electorate the Ballina Rotary club with this incredible initiative. In particular, I want to thank Dave Harmon for his community led action and the difference it's making every day throughout our region. They are essentially transforming the lives of so many people, and they've told me firsthand that many people in businesses are wearing the shirts on Purple Shirt Friday. They'll start conversations with people, and they can then refer them for some assistance. It has really taken off. A lot of the Rotary clubs on the North Coast are wearing the Purple Shirt Friday shirts, and a lot of conversations are being had right across the community. As I said, the inspirational work of Dave is truly phenomenal, and I certainly look forward to continuing to work with him. The national day of action for Rotary Pacific is on Friday 29 November, and I encourage all members to show their support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Dave and the Rotary club of Ballina receive widespread bipartisan support, as well. At his launch there were members from right across the parliament. I know that everyone in this House is committed to ending violence against women and children in one generation. They were all there for the launch to show their support and to show that we are all standing together. I commend Dave and everyone at the Rotary Club of Ballina-on-Richmond for this great initiative and the work they are doing. It will be great if we can all wear purple shirts on Fridays to make a difference in each and every community right across the nation.</span>

                  <a href="230886" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  Last night the Parliamentary Friends of the Space Industry group convened a very large group of not only space enthusiasts but organisations, companies and businesses from across Australia that are doing some fantastic work in the space industry. I had the opportunity to meet with many of those people last night, some of whom I have worked with for a very long period of time, to hear how the space sector in Australia is going. Clearly, it is a sector that deserves and needs more support from the Australian government so that it can grow and meet our future needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To put some context around my comments, when I was Minister for Industry, Science and Technology I commissioned the standing committee on industry, science and resources to have a look at the space industry and its impact on Australia. They found that the global industry is predicted to grow to be worth almost $1.5 trillion over the next 20 years. There was a very strong endorsement of the policy at the time, which was the goal of the government to increase that sector so Australia's space sector could build its revenue to about $12 billion and create an additional 20,000 jobs by 2030. That would give Australia a much greater slice of the space industry than we had at the time and, quite frankly, than we have now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The obvious question is: why the space industry and why is it important to us? There are multiple reasons. I'll just go through a couple of those today. Already, space is part of our everyday lives, and we are becoming increasingly reliant on the space sector and what it offers us. There are things like online shopping, e-banking, the news we rely on coming through our mobile devices, staying connected with our friends and family, navigating our way through traffic and finding out what the weather is predicted to be. Importantly, it helps us with our disaster responses so that we get greater predictions and support with what is happening with things such as bushfires and floods. We get much greater support to protect our borders to keep Australia safe. These are all very good reasons why we need to make sure that we support this sector in Australia and that we do everything we possibly can to grow it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be able to do that and to do that effectively, we have to ensure that we increase the number of people we have with STEM qualifications and skills—so science, technology, engineering and maths. There was a report released earlier this year, <span style="font-style:italic;">STEM career pathway</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span>, which had some really interesting findings. We have all known for a long time that we need to encourage more people to study science and maths, particularly at school. That report reinforced it, and some of the statistics in there are quite alarming to me in terms of making sure we do have the people we need to fill the jobs of the future. I'll read through a couple of quotes from the report. It found: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Over the 20-year period to February 2020, before the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labour market, employment in STEM occupations grew by 85.0%, or more than twice the rate of non-STEM occupations (which grew by 40.2%).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That trend continued over the subsequent years. The report says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Employment in STEM occupations (using science, technology, engineering and maths skills) is projected by the NSC to grow by 12.9%, well above the average of all occupations (of 7.8%) and more than twice as fast as non-STEM occupations (6.2%).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, to meet the urgent workforce needs we have here in Australia, we not only must go through the process of ensuring that we are training our students at school to follow STEM pathways but also need to make sure that we're doing all that we can to retain people in the workforce, because we know that often people, particularly women, will move out of a STEM workforce, for a whole range of reasons. The report focuses on some of the things that we need to do, and I would urge everyone in this parliament to do all that they can to ensure that we are increasing our STEM capability in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  Brain Injury Awareness Week is held annually between 19 and 25 August to raise awareness of brain injury and its impact on everyday Australians. The brain is critical to how we think, feel, behave and act. Brain injury can lead to significant change in people's lives and can have devastating long-term effects if left undiagnosed and untreated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was my great pleasure to host a presentation in Parliament House during Brain Injury Awareness Week of the 'healthy head' campaign demonstration which is running in Alice Springs and Central Australia. I appreciate the time given by the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the Assistant Minister for Indigenous Health to attend this presentation and learn about the importance of this campaign for my electorate. A partnership between the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine—and I give a shout out to Dr Stephen Gourley, who is also in charge of the Alice Springs accident and emergency hospital—Alan Cass and all the staff at the Menzies School of Health Research, and the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress, this campaign will help improve the treatment and management of concussion and head trauma for Aboriginal patients and in particular Aboriginal women. The Alice Springs emergency department is seeing a huge increase in the number of Aboriginal women who have suffered domestic and family violence. This demonstration project will produce consistent best practice guidelines and protocols for treating head trauma injury presentations that will eventually be applied in hospital emergency departments and community health centre settings throughout Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brain injury related to intimate partner violence often remains underreported or undetected during clinical assessments. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are especially impacted, being 60 times more likely than non-Indigenous women to have a head injury due to assaults. Recent research has highlighted various workforce barriers affecting prescreening and diagnostic assessments of trauma and brain injuries, including limited access to specialists, neuropsychology services and stable primary healthcare professionals with remote expertise.</span>

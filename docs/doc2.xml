              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Superannuation</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4442 regarding borrowing within a self-managed superannuation fund.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Money borrowed by a self-managed superannuation fund under a limited recourse borrowing arrangement for the acquisition of an asset cannot be used to improve the value of the asset. As energy efficiency capital improvements are an improvement to the value of a rental property, this is not allowable under a limited recourse borrowing arrangement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Borrowing within a superannuation fund inherently adds risk to the safety of retirement savings. Since superannuation receives substantial tax concessions designed to encourage people to save for retirement, it is important that there are safeguards in place to ensure that superannuation is preserved for its intended purpose of supporting income in retirement. Therefore, limited recourse borrowing arrangements applied for the acquisition of an asset cannot be used to improve the asset, as this could fundamentally change the nature of the asset used as security by the lender, potentially increasing the risk to the fund.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, accumulated funds held by a self-managed superannuation fund can be used to finance capital improvements to assets acquired under a limited recourse borrowing arrangement, including energy efficiency improvements to rental properties. This is provided that the improvements do not fundamentally change the nature of the asset.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government considers that the current settings strike the right balance between allowing trustee(s) to maximise the returns in the superannuation funds and preserving superannuation for its purpose of providing retirement income.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 20 March 2023 to the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Andrew Giles MP, enclosing Petition EN4784, with 5506 signatures, concerning Australia's policy towards asylum seekers. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware, the Australian Government has provided a permanent visa pathway to existing Temporary Protection visa {TPV) and Safe Haven Enterprise visa (SHEV) holders. This permanent visa pathway has been made available through the permanent Resolution of Status (RoS) (subclass 851) visa.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Providing a permanent visa pathway to existing TPV and SHEV holders will empower them to move forward with their lives and to more fully contribute to Australia, gain secure employment, grow businesses, study more easily, sponsor eligible family members under the family stream of the Migration Program to Australia and pursue a pathway to Australian citizenship.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">People granted a permanent RoS visa will be afforded the same rights and benefits as all permanent residents. Importantly, access to social security payments, the National Disability Insurance Scheme and some higher education assistance schemes will be available immediately, with no waiting periods.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The RoS pathway has been made available for those who held or applied for a TPV or SHEV before 14 February 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information regarding the TPV/SHEV transition to RoS visas and fact sheets in different languages can be found on the Department of Home Affairs website at: https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/resolution-of-status- 851#About.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to implementing this measure in an efficient and effective manner to ensure the majority of the caseload are granted a RoS visa within 12 months of processing commencement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Persons who do not engage protection obligations, who are not awaiting a merits or judicial review outcome, and who have exhausted all avenues to remain in Australia, are expected to depart Australia voluntarily and may be provided assistance to depart.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to efficiently assessing each protection claim on its individual merits, on a case-by-case basis, with reference to up-to-date information on conditions in the applicant's home country. Principles of procedural fairness apply at all stages of visa decision making and most individuals have access to merits and judicial review of refusal decisions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For applicants who have never held a TPV/SHEV, any TPV or SHEV applications remitted by the Immigration Assessment Authority (IAA), Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) or by the courts on or after 14 February 2023 will be assessed against the criteria for grant of a TPV/SHEV. If the applicant satisfies the criteria for the grant of a TPV/SHEV, the application will be converted to a RoS visa application.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has announced reform to Australia's system of administrative review. This reform will abolish the AAT and replace it with a new federal administrative review body.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Please note that all cases currently before the AAT or IAA will continue. Many cases currently before the AAT/IAA will be decided or finalised before the new federal administrative review body is established. Any remaining cases will transition to the new review body.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government remains committed to delivering orderly and legal pathways to Australia through robust migration and humanitarian programs. As such, the Government has committed to maintaining Operation Sovereign Borders, including regional processing arrangements. Under this approach, anyone who attempts to travel to Australia by boat without a valid visa will be turned back to their point of departure, returned to their home country, or transferred to a regional processing country for assessment of their protection claims. The Government is also committed to finding durable migration outcomes for people under regional processing arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government of Nauru is responsible for the implementation of regional processing arrangements in Nauru, including the management of individuals under those arrangements. Australia supports Nauru to implement arrangements through the provision of contracted service providers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Transitory persons in Nauru are not detained and are residing and working in the community. They have access to a variety of health and welfare services, including mental health services, delivered through the Regional Processing Centre Medical Centre and the Republic of Nauru Hospital. Clinical assessment and treatment is provided by a multi-disciplinary team of health practitioners, including general practitioners, nurses and counselling specialists. Specialist health services include psychology, psychiatry, dentistry, obstetrics, radiography and pharmacy services. Where clinically indicated specialist medical treatment is not available in Nauru, mechanisms are in place for temporary transfer to a third country for assessment and treatment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The former Government ended Australia's regional processing association in Papua New Guinea (PNG) on 31 December 2021. PNG independently manages individuals remaining in PNG on a permanent or temporary pathway, including providing ongoing settlement support and services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to finding durable migration outcomes for people under regional processing arrangements and continue to support the implementation of third country resettlement arrangements with the United States and New Zealand.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Over 1,000 people have already been resettled in the United States and several hundred have expressed interest in New Zealand resettlement. The Government is aware of transitory persons engaged in the Canadian Private Sponsorship of Refugees program, and is providing logistical assistance to Canada. Individuals are strongly encouraged to engage with available migration options. Third country resettlement provides the best available opportunity for individuals to achieve permanent migration outcomes and start the next phase of their lives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Transitory persons brought to Australia from a regional processing country, such as for medical treatment, are here for a temporary purpose only. Transitory persons will not be settled in Australia and are expected to engage with third country migration options to depart Australia as soon as possible. Support and information is available for individuals to connect with existing migration options.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Individuals under regional processing arrangements have lived with uncertainty about their future since they arrived in 2013-14, and resettlement in a third country provides a permanent migration outcome not available here. Individuals are strongly encouraged to engage with available migration options. Third country resettlement provides the best available opportunity for individuals to build a path to a new life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-style:italic;">The Migration Act 1958 </span>(the Act) creates a statutory framework regulating the entry and stay of non-citizens in Australia. Under the Act, non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa are liable for detention. However, immigration detention is used as a last resort and where possible, non-citizens are managed in the community pending resolution of their status.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The decision to place a person in held immigration detention is based on an assessment of risk to the Australian community. The length and conditions of immigration detention are subject to regular review by senior officers of the Department, as well as external independent review by the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Australian Human Rights Commission.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Act, detention is not limited by a set timeframe; rather, it ends when the person is either granted a visa or is removed from Australia. The Department always seeks to resolve the status of detainees in the shortest timeframe practicable; however, this is dependent upon a number of factors, including the level of cooperation of detainees towards immigration processes, or case complexity including in relation to health, character and/or security matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to its international obligations set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees </span>and its <span style="font-style:italic;">1967 Protocol </span>and other international human rights conventions to which it is a party. Australia does not return individuals to situations where they face persecution or a real risk of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary deprivation of life or the application of the death penalty.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is, and will remain, a multicultural society of people drawn from a rich variety of cultural backgrounds. The Government knows the important social and economic contribution migrants and refugees have had through our nation's history.</span>

                </span>Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 May 2023 enclosing Petition EN4995, with 14 signatures, concerning the removal of Mr Julian Taylor from Australia. I apologise for the delayed response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government remains committed in its role of protecting the Australian community from risk of harm by non-citizens. It is expected that all non-citizens are law-abiding and continue to satisfy the requirements of the character test, as defined by section 501 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958 </span>(the Act). Where individuals pose a risk to the community, the Australian Government will continue to cancel their visas and remove them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 21 December 2018, Mr Taylor's Class BB Subclass 155 Five Year Resident Return visa was cancelled under section 501(3A) of the Act on the basis of his substantial criminal record, having been sentenced to a full time term of imprisonment of 12 months or more. Between 22 October 2020 and 30 August 2022, Mr Taylor made a series of appeals in regards to his visa cancellation. Ultimately, on 8 December 2022, the High Court of Australia refused Mr Taylor's application for special leave.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Taylor has reached the end of his appeal options in respect of his visa cancellation. On 6 January 2023, Mr Taylor was informed that he was on a removal pathway and that the department will make arrangements for his involuntary departure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 3 February 2023, Mr Taylor lodged section 195A and section 197AB onshore Ministerial Intervention applications.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 2 March 2023, Mr Taylor was issued a Notice of Intention to Remove with an approximate removal date of 17 March 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 3 March 2023, Ministerial Direction 99 came into effect which made long-term residence in Australia a primary consideration in character-related visa decision¬ making.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ministerial Direction 99 required decision-makers in both the Department of Home Affairs and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) to give greater consideration to the length of time a person has resided in Australia, when considering whether to refuse or cancel a visa under section 501 of the Act, and whether to revoke a mandatory cancellation decision, for all non-citizens.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This consideration needed to be balanced against other considerations including the seriousness of the conduct and expectations of the Australian community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ministerial Direction 99 could not be applied retrospectively. Non-citizens who have had their visa refused or cancelled under section 501 of the Act, or were subject to mandatory cancellation of a visa under section 501CA of the Act based on previous Ministerial Directions, or have had their case finalised, cannot have that decision changed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to note that Ministerial Direction 99 was a guide to character-related visa decision-making under section 499 of the Act. The Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs cannot direct a delegate of the Minister to reach a particular outcome.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 17 March 2023, Mr Taylor was found not to meet the section 195A and section 197AB guidelines for referral to the Minister.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa will be liable for removal from Australia, pending resolution of any ongoing matters.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 August 2023 regarding Petition EN5135, requesting that gender affirming care not be covered under Medicare.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to supporting all Australians to access high quality health care by providing Medicare benefits (rebate) for services listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), subsidised pharmaceuticals available through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and free hospital services for public patients in public hospitals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently some surgical procedures that may be performed in the gender affirmation process attract a Medicare rebate. The Government relies on the judgement of health practitioners in determining the appropriate care for patients and upholding the principle of clinical relevance when deciding whether a procedure is necessary for a particular patient.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I can advise that the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) has recently received an application for the public funding of patient consultations and surgical procedures for gender affirmation in adults with gender incongruence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">MSAC is an independent, expert advisory group which provides advice to the Government on whether a new medical service or technology should be publicly funded, based on an assessment of the comparative safety, clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and total costs of services and/or procedures, using the best available evidence. The MSAC commonly assesses applications for new services seeking public funding on the MBS. Any person or organisation can submit an application to the MSAC for the consideration of public funding of a medical service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The application will be considered following standard MSAC processes. The MSAC seeks feedback from relevant clinical and consumer organisations as part of the appraisal process for an application. Information about the MSAC consultation process can be found on the MSAC website at www.msac.gov.au/internet/msac/publishing.nsf/Content/MSAC-Consultation-Process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will consider the advice from MSAC on this issue when received. Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Parental Leave</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 11 September 2023 regarding petition EN5229 about fair and equitable access to parental leave. The Australian Government is committed to parental leave that supports families to balance work and care responsibilities. I acknowledge the concerns raised in the petition about the qualifying period to access parental leave entitlements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Parental leave in Australia is facilitated by the government-funded Paid Parental Leave scheme and unpaid parental leave in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009. </span>Parental leave is an employee benefit received when an employee or an employee's partner gives birth (including adoption, surrogacy and stillbirth). The National Employment Standards in the Fair Work Act provide eligible employees an entitlement to 12 months of unpaid parental leave. Employees must have worked for their employer for at least 12 months before the date of birth or expected date of birth if the employee is pregnant, the date of adoption, or when the leave starts (if taken after another person who cares for the child takes parental leave).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's current focus is expanding the Paid Parental Leave scheme that provides financial support to eligible working parents to support them to take time off work to care for their newborn or recently adopted child. The Paid Parental Leave scheme currently provides up to 20 weeks of payment, with 2 weeks reserved for each parent. Subject to the passage of legislation, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Paid Parental Leave Amendment (More Support for Working Families) Bill </span>2023 will expand payments under the Paid Parental Leave scheme to 26 weeks by 2026, with 4 weeks of the entitlement reserved for each parent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Employers may provide paid parental leave in addition to the Government's Paid Parental Leave scheme, as well as unpaid parental leave policies above the minimum entitlement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN5240 for a proposed 'Mercy Amendment' to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Corporations Act 2001 </span>(the Corporations Act). I appreciate the petitioners are very concerned about whistleblowing protections for victims of human rights breaches such as disability discrimination.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The whistleblower regime under the Corporations Act provides protection to whistleblowers against detriment related to the making of an eligible disclosure. Criminal offences and civil penalties may apply to companies or individuals that cause or threaten to cause detriment to a whistleblower or for breaching a whistleblower's confidentiality. Eligible whistleblowers include employees of a regulated entity and their spouse or relative. Regulated entities include companies and incorporated associations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The private-sector whistleblowing regime sets out four key criteria that must be met for protection as a whistleblower:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">1. <span style="font-style:italic;">The role of the whistleblower</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span>people who can make disclosures include officers of a company or other regulated entity, employees, supplier, associate of the company or regulated entity, or their relatives. In all cases, the whistleblower holds the right to remain anonymous.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">2. <span style="font-style:italic;">The company or organisation to which the disclosure relates</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span>the regulated entities that the disclosure is about can include companies, bank (Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions), general or life insurers, or superannuation funds and trustees.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">3. <span style="font-style:italic;">To whom the disclosure is made</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span>disclosures must be made to certain recipients to be protected including a director, auditor (or member of an audit team), actuary, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) or the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">4. <span style="font-style:italic;">The subject of the disclosure</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span>whistleblowers must have reasonable grounds to suspect that the information they are disclosing about the company or regulated entity concerns misconduct or improper states of affairs or circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This information can be about the company or organisation, or an officer or employee of the company or organisation, engaging in conduct that breaches the Corporations Act or other financial sector laws, is an offence against any other law of the Commonwealth punishable by imprisonment for a period of 12 months or more, or represents a danger to the public or the financial system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">ASIC is Australia's corporate regulator. More information about whistleblower eligibility and protections, and information on how ASIC handles reports are available at: https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/asic-investigations-and-enforcement/whistleblowing/.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does not intend to make any changes regarding the 'Mercy Amendment' at this time. The whistleblower regime under the Corporations Act will soon be the subject of a statutory review which will provide an opportunity to consider these issues. The review must take place as soon as practicable after 1 July 2024. It will examine the effectiveness of the whistleblowing regime and whether any further changes should be made to protect and promote whistleblowing. As part of this review, interested parties will have the opportunity to submit their views.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN5358 on requesting the RBA to disallow surcharging on non-cash transactions of all types.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) are responsible for regulating surcharging.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The RBA first introduced rules relating to surcharging in the early 2000s, allowing merchants to recover a reasonable cost of accepting relevant cards by imposing a surcharge. Today, a surcharge must only reflect the costs borne by the merchant to accept the card payment. The Government has banned excessive surcharging under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Competition and Consumer Amendment (Payment Surcharges) Act 2016</span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ACCC is responsible for enforcing the ban on excessive surcharging. More information for consumers is available at: https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/prices-surcharges-receipts/credit-debit-prepaid-card- surcharges.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The RBA's Surcharging Standard requires banks to ensure merchants receive statements which clearly outline merchants' average cost of acceptance for each card scheme. This Standard is available at: www.rba.gov.au/payments-and-infrastructure/review-of-card-payments-regulation. The Standard is reviewed every three years and allows merchants to calculate their surcharge based on clearly documented cost information. The RBA also conducts a review of retail payments regulation every three years, with the next one due this year.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">War memorials in all their forms across Australia are an important, and tangible way communities recognise this service and sacrifice of all those Australians who have served in wars, conflicts, and peace operations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government does not have jurisdiction over community, private or State and local council managed memorials. These memorials are usually erected by ex-service groups, veterans or their families and community members under arrangements with local Councils or State Governments. Their dedication, use and maintenance are managed under similar arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian War Memorial' s Places of Pride initiative exists to record the location and photo of every publicly accessible war memorial in Australia. Community organisations, RSL sub-branches, local councils, schools, sporting groups and individuals are invited to contribute to this by sharing information and stories and uploading photographs. The initiative has over 11,700 memorials recorded. More information is available at placesofpride.awm.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Listing a memorial on Places of Pride does not constitute a heritage listing. In order for a place to be heritage listed at the national level, it must have 'outstanding' heritage value to the nation. This means that it must be important to the Australian community as a whole. The majority of war memorials in Australia are unique to a local community or region. Heritage listing a memorial would be a matter for consideration at the State/Territory level, given the different eligibility requirements across jurisdictions.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government can provide funding to assist the construction and restoration of war memorials, under DVA's Saluting Their Service (STS) Commemorative Grants Program.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The STS Program is an open-competitive program, which means that anyone can apply.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 December 2023 to the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Andrew Giles MP, enclosing Petition EN5560, with 24 signatures, concerning ongoing protests in response to the Hamas-Israel conflict. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises that there are many Australians deeply distressed by the ongoing Hamas-Israel conflict and continues to urge communities in Australia to remain respectful. While this distress is understandable, it is important that the Australian community remains cohesive and the Government strongly condemns anyone who incites violence and hatred within our community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a long democratic history of recognition of the right to peaceful protest.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our democracy also recognises this right is subject to general laws and must be balanced against the rights and interests of others and the community. While we respect the right for anyone in Australia to protest peacefully, violence will not be tolerated. The Australian Government has full confidence in state and territory police to manage any local protest activity. Individuals and communities planning a protest may be required to contact state or territory police, who can provide advice and assistance with safety, security matters and traffic controls.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government will continue to act decisively to protect the community from the risk of harm posed by individuals who choose to engage in criminal activity or behaviour of concern, including visa cancellation where appropriate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All non-citizens must meet, and continue to meet, the requirements set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958 </span>(the Migration Act) and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Regulations 1994</span>, including identity, security, health and character requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If a person fails to comply with their visa conditions, engages in criminal activity or other behaviour of concern their visa may be considered for cancellation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Migration Act provides the legal framework for the removal of unlawful non-citizens from Australia. This includes unlawful non-citizens whose visa has expired, whose visa has been cancelled or whose visa application has been refused. Under the Migration Act, a departmental officer has an obligation to remove an unlawful non-citizen who is liable for removal from Australia as soon as reasonably practicable.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 26 February 2024 to the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Andrew Giles MP, enclosing Petition EN5768, with 4988 signatures, concerning the reduction of the maximum age from 50 to 35 years for the Temporary Graduate visa (TGV). Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the concerns raised regarding recent announcements by myself and Minister Giles, on the age limitation adjustment for the TGV program outlined in the Migration Strategy. You will be pleased to hear that the Government has decided to retain the current age limit of 50 years of age for Masters by research and PHO graduates, due to their potential to contribute to Australia's economy and given they are typically older on average than other graduates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For other graduates above the age of 35, a number of options remain for them upon completion of their studies, including temporary and permanent skilled visa products. These visas ensure graduates have skilled jobs and clear pathways to permanent residency and citizenship, which helps avoid many graduates from becoming 'permanently temporary'. Home Affairs will be facilitating a number of roundtables with education providers and employers over coming months that will outline many of these options for graduates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information on these changes can be found on the Home Affairs website at https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/temporary-graduate-485/changes. Thank you for bringing Petition EN5768 to my attention.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding a petition for access to Health Care Cards (HCC) for individuals with epilepsy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government provides a range of support for people with severe medical conditions in recognition of the significant financial and emotional demands on individuals and families.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under social security law, access to Government concession cards is determined based on financial need, rather than medical condition. Most Government concession cards are only available to recipients of social security payments, low-income earners, or certain self-funded retirees. The cards issued by the Government are the Pensioner Concession Card, the HCC and the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Income and assets tests apply to most income support payments and are considered the fairest way to ensure the available funds are directed to those in the community with the greatest need, as determined by social security law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Low Income (LIHCC) is one of a small number of Government concession cards that can be issued to people who are not receiving a social security payment. The card is available to people with a low income, and is determined by their gross income, for the eight weeks immediately before they make a claim for the card.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, the qualifying income limit for a single person with one dependent child is $1,315 per week. The LIHCC income limits are linked to the amount of income a single-income couple can earn before they stop being paid JobSeeker Payment. This is consistent with the low-income workers, who are the primary intended cohort for the card.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Once a person qualifies for the LIHCC, the relevant income limit can be exceeded by up to 25% before eligibility for the card is lost. For example, once qualified, a single person with one dependent child could earn up to $1,643 a week and still retain the card. This allows for some fluctuation in earnings for intermittent and part-time workers. The LIHCC is issued for an initial period of 52 weeks. After that, if a person still requires a card, they must again meet the qualifying income limits.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where a person does not qualify for a concession card, the Government provides assistance with prescription and medical costs through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and Medicare.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 2023-24 Budget delivered landmark investments, including $6.1 billion in strengthening Medicare measures to revamp primary health care. This investment assists complex and chronic disease management, with improved support for bulk billing ($3.5 billion), longer consultations and multidisciplinary based care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the 2024-25 Budget, the Government announced that the indexation of PBS co¬ payment for people without a concession would be frozen for 12 months. Subject to legislation, the maximum co-payment will remain at $31.60 until 1 January 2026.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The PBS Safety Net provides assistance to those people who require a large number of PBS prescriptions over a calendar year. In 2024, once a person without a concession card has paid $1,647.90 in PBS co-payments, they pay for further PBS prescriptions at the concessional co-payment rate of $7.70 per prescription for the rest of the calendar year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Extended Medicare Safety Net provides additional Medicare benefits for families and singles who have out-of-pocket costs for Medicare eligible out-of-hospital services once an annual threshold has been met. In 2024, the annual threshold for people without a concession card is $2,544.30.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the above, the Epilepsy Foundation was awarded $20 million over a period of four years (2019-20 to 2022-23) for the implementation of the Epilepsy Smart Australia Program (ESAP). The ESAP is a comprehensive national program for epilepsy support and management, encompassing the establishment of the National Epilepsy Support Service. This service provides individualised support, education, and training.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Middle East</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your referring petition EN5932 to me, which relates to the Australian Victim of Terrorism Overseas Payment (AVTOP) scheme and a permanent ceasefire in the Hamas-Israel conflict.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I know the conflict in the Middle East is deeply distressing for many Australians, including the many Australians with a connection to the region and loved ones directly impacted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The widespread human suffering we are witnessing in Gaza is completely unacceptable. This cannot continue. This war must end.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While Australia is not a central player, we have a respected voice and we are using it to advocate for a ceasefire, the protection of civilians, increased humanitarian assistance and the release of hostages.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice and our vote in international institutions and forums. In December, Australia voted with 152countries for a ceasefire at the United Nations, and we support the ceasefire proposal endorsed by the UN Security Council in June this year. We want to see it fully implemented by both parties. Any delay will only see more lives lost.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have pressed for a ceasefire, protection of civilians, humanitarian aid and the release of hostages through persistent and extensive engagement with foreign counterparts, including during my visit to the Middle East, as well as with partners in Europe, Canada, Japan, the UK, the US and in our region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have pressed the Netanyahu Government directly, as have Government officials in Canberra and in Israel. We continue to make clear Australia's objection to Israel's operation in Rafah and our expectation that Israel act in accordance with international humanitarian law. We have been clear with Israel that it must comply with the binding orders of the International Court of Justice, including to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance at scale. The Australian Government is denying anyone identified as an extremist settler a visa to travel to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are pressing countries with influence over Hamas, to help secure the immediate and unconditional release of remaining hostages. We remain unequivocal in our condemnation of Hamas's horrific terror attacks of 7 October 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We have adopted the most supportive position on recognition of any Australian government in history. We support recognition of a Palestinian state as a part of a peace process. And we are taking actions to make that possible. We want the legitimate aspirations of Palestinians to be realised—because a two-state solution is necessary for a just and enduring peace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In May, Australia supported expanded Palestinian rights to participate in UN forums and the General Assembly's aspiration for eventual Palestinian membership of the United Nations, consistent with a two-state solution. Alongside key partners, we are looking at how we can support reform of the Palestinian Authority so that it can deliver on the needs of the Palestinian people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 2 February 2024, the Australian Government activated the AVTOP scheme to support all Australians impacted by the 7 October 2023 Hamas terrorist attacks. The AVTOP scheme provides financial assistance of up to $75,000 for Australian residents who are harmed, or whose close family member is killed, as a direct result of a declared overseas terrorist act. The AVTOP scheme acknowledges the collective responsibility of the Australian community to help individuals, and their families, recover from overseas terrorist acts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This devastating crisis demonstrates the need for a political solution to the long running Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Australia remains steadfast in our support for a two-state solution—a Palestinian state and the State of Israel, living side by side in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to the petitioners.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Veterans</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 14 May 2024 regarding Petition EN5935.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Petition EN5935 seeks amendment of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 </span>(VEA) to reduce the timeframe provided in subsection 137(1) for the provision of information from the Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs (OVA) to an applicant for a review by the Veterans' Review Board (the Board) from 'within six weeks' to seven days.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that it is the petitioners' belief that contemporary OVA electronic document storage practices means that the evidence can be instantly identified and retrieved, allowing Section 137 reports to be prepared and forwarded within a few hours or, at worst, a few days.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The phrase 'within six weeks' refers to the maximum timeframe in which the report under Section 137 is to be prepared by the Secretary and provided to the applicant who has made an application for review to the Board. This timeframe allows for a variety of administrative activities to be performed while factoring in the completion of competing work priorities. In some instances, documents relevant to the application for review may need to be retrieved from department archives. An appropriate timeframe is required to ensure the information is complete and accurate before it is provided to the applicant and subsequently to the Board to consider the application.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Furthermore, it has been a longstanding practice of the department to intervene before the report has to go to the Board where we may be able to make a new and beneficial decision in favour of the applicant. An appointed internal Review Officer will familiarise themselves with the facts of the case and review additional documents provided by the applicant to ensure that the decision was correct and in accordance with the legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the proposed reform and harmonisation of veterans' legislation, subject to passage of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements, </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024 (the </span>VETS Bill), future claims for compensation for all veterans, regardless of the time and nature of their service, would be covered under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 </span>(MRCA). The Exposure Draft of the proposed changes to the MRCA legislation recommends a single review pathway.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 3, Part 1, Division 1, Section 10 of the VETS Bill seeks to amend the current legislation and introduce into the MRCA sections 352C and 352D. These would be applicable to Petition EN5935 as, if passed, they will mean that:</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">if an application for review is made to the Board, the Board must, as soon as practicable after receiving the application, give the Commission written notice of the application; and that</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">within 28 days after the Board notifies the Commission under section 352C of an application for review of an original determination, the Commission must cause a report to be prepared that refers to the evidence on which the original determination was based.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These changes would represent a reasonable reduction in the time. Frame for the Commission to provide the report to the applicant, with the aim of delivering quality decisions and sustainable outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for taking the time to bring this matter to my attention. I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

It criminalises a range of criminal behaviour online including, online child sexual exploitation and abuse, harassment and computer crime.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition also makes particular reference to the rising use of online platforms to perpetrate family and domestic violence. The government is committed to ending violence against women and their children. All Australian Governments are working to deliver on the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 2022-2032 </span>(National Plan). The National Plan includes technology-facilitated abuse as a key area of focus to address gender-based violence in Australia. The government has delivered a record $3.4 billion since October 2022 to support the National Plan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, National Cabinet met on 1 May 2024 and agreed to a number of priorities to build on existing efforts under the National Plan. In response to this, the government will be introducing a suite of measures to help combat toxic views about women online. Other online safety measures to be led by the government include an age assurance technology trial and prioritising ongoing classification reforms to examine options to reduce exposure to violent pornography. The Government has also recently launched a new phase of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Stop it at the Start </span>campaign, which includes a focus on countering violent and misogynistic content.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government will continue to work to keep Australians safe online and hold those that commit technology-facilitated abuse and cybercrime (such online scams and fraud), accountable for their actions.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">E-Cigarettes and Vaping Products</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 May 2024 regarding petition number EN5940, requesting a revision of legislative changes affecting the regulation of e-cigarettes (vaping products) and related matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is taking clear action to reduce smoking and vaping rates through stronger legislation, enforcement, education, and support. This is because, despite Australia's success in reducing smoking rates over decades; tobacco continues to be the leading cause of preventable death and disability in Australia. There is evidence that non-smokers who vape are more likely to take up smoking, compared to those who do not vape. Normalisation of vaping has the potential to disrupt Australia's significant achievements in tobacco control.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-weight:bold;">
                </span>Recent data shows that among people aged 14 years and over, current use of vaping goods nearly tripled between 2019 (2.5%) and 2022-2023 (7.0%). The increase was even more marked among young people, with current use of vaping goods increasing from 5.3% to 21% among people aged 18 to 24, and from 1.8% to 9.7% among people aged 14 to 17 during the same period. For more information you can visit the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare website at www.pp.aihw.gov.au and by searching the term 'Vaping and e-cigarette use in the NDSHS'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Therapeutic Goods and Other Legislation Amendment (Vaping Reforms) Act 2024 </span>commenced on 1 July 2024. The Act forms a key piece of Australia's world-leading vaping reforms by prohibiting retailers such as tobacconists, vape shops and convenience stores from selling any type of vape. The Act also puts in place nationally consistent rules on the importation, domestic manufacture, supply, commercial possession and advertisement of all vapes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These reforms protect young Australians and the broader community from the increasing health risks of vaping, while ensuring patients who legitimately need vapes to quit smoking or manage nicotine dependence can still access them. The Act builds on the Government's initial reforms to vaping products which commenced earlier in 2024, including a ban on the importation of disposable single-use vapes from 1 January 2024;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 July 2024, all vapes, regardless of whether they contain nicotine or not, must be sold in a pharmacy. In addition, everyone will need a prescription from a doctor or nurse practitioner to buy vapes containing nicotine. Medical and nurse practitioners can prescribe therapeutic vapes for smoking cessation or the management of nicotine dependence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This requirement for a prescription will be in place until 30 September 2024. More information is available at www.tga.gov.au and by searching the term 'Vapes: information for patients and consumers'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Zero-nicotine substances and vapes will continue to be available to patients. The notified vapes list, which does include zero-nicotine products, will inform practitioners and pharmacists of vapes that can be lawfully prescribed or dispensed to patients. More information is available on the TGA's website by searching the term 'List of notified vapes'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 October 2024, further changes will come into place allowing patients aged 18 years and over to access vapes from a pharmacy without a prescription. These changes will help facilitate appropriate access to vapes for adults while maintaining appropriate controls and protections.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to provide support for people who vape and/or smoke to quit and remain tobacco and vape free. Support is available from health professionals such as GPs, pharmacists, nurses, and specialists. Confidential advice is also available through the Quitline (13 78 48).<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>Smoking cessation products that have been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration following a rigorous assessment of their safety, quality, and efficacy also continue to be available, and some products are subsidised under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also committed to several activities to increase vaping and smoking cessation support. These initiatives will build on existing measures and resources and include:</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 14 May 2024 regarding Petition EN5943, which proposes a nationwide independent review of Telstra services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petition requests the House of Representatives conduct an independent nationwide review of Telstra services, specifically the effectiveness of these services in regional and remote Australia. The petition states the National Broadband Network (NBN) is not available in parts of regional and remote Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the importance of ensuring that all Australians have access to affordable, high-speed and reliable internet all across the country, especially in regional and remote areas. The NBN is the default platform for access to high speed broadband services across Australia. Access to fixed voice services is also currently provided by Telstra under the Universal Service Obligation. As set out further below, the Government has a number of measures in place, and is targeted investment focused on ensuring improved access to mobile and fixed telecommunications services in regional and remote Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span style="font-style:italic;">
                </span>Further, an independent review into telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia must be undertaken every three years in line with the requirements of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee for the 2024 review was announced on 25 January 2024 and the Committee is unde1iaking its work at present. More information on the review, including details on how to engage with the Committee is available at www.rtirc.gov.au.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is investing $2.2 billion in improvements to regional connectivity.

The overall investment also includes upgrades to NBN services in regional areas.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has provided $480 million towards an upgrade of the NBN fixed wireless network by the end of 2024. This upgrade is also benefitting NBN satellite services.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">NBN Co Limited (NBN Co) is using the latest 4G and 5G wireless technology to extend the coverage range from existing NBN fixed wireless towers, which is allowing higher speed services to everyone served by the towers. Under the upgrade, the fixed wireless footprint coverage will be expanded by up to 50 per cent, enabling 120,000 additional premises to access fixed wireless services instead of Sky Muster satellite services. Around three quarters of a million premises will be able to access fixed wireless services following the upgrades.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All premises in the new, expanded fixed wireless coverage footprint will be able to access higher peak speed services of 100 megabits per second (Mbps) download with peak upload speeds of up to 20 Mbps. Residents on plans with speeds of at least 50 Mbps will be able to attain typical wholesale speeds of at least 50 Mbps download during the busy hours. Those residents that have chosen lower speed plans will also experience a better quality of service over fixed wireless as a result of the upgrades.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As the upgrade rollout has progressed, NBN Co has found the network is capable of delivering even better speeds above and beyond the original commitments. New speed tiers have now been delivered under the upgrade that offer speeds close to double those originally planned, with 80 per cent of fixed wireless premises nationally expected to be able to access download speeds of up to 400 Mbps and upload speeds of 10-40 Mbps by the end of 2024.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">For sate1lite users, the movement of premises off the NBN Sky Muster sate1lites is relieving satellite capacity, allowing NBN Co to enhance its satellite products. The upgrades will also generally enhance NBN Sky Muster satellite service performance.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The upgrade has enabled NBN Co to launch a new product, Sky Muster Plus Premium, which is fully unmetered, the first Sky Muster product to have such a feature. This product can offer speeds of up to 100 Mbps.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of this investment, NBN Co is extending fibre deeper into many fibre to the node (FTTN) areas to provide the option of higher speeds as customer demand emerges over the next few years. Eligible premises connected to the NBN, via FTTN technology, that require higher speeds will be able to access higher wholesale speed tiers via fibre to the premises (FTTP) technology. This will be done by using existing fibre infrastructure already built to nodes and investing in the continued rollout of fibre deeper into neighbourhoods.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">NBN Co's fibre upgrade program has been boosted by the Government's $2.4 billion equity investment to expand full-fibre access to 1.5 million additional premises by the end of 2025. Importantly, this investment will provide full-fibre access to an additional 660,000 premises in regional areas.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Veterans</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 14 May 2024 regarding petition EN5961 seeking changes to the Statements of Principles (SoPs) issued by Repatriation Medical Authority (RMA) for use in the determination of certain compensation claims by Australian veterans in respect of Tooth Wear.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand that the petitioners seek to have a clause added to the SoPs for Tooth Wear to the effect that these SoPs exclude the condition of minor tooth wear, and that claims for this condition can be considered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) as 'non-SoP' conditions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Section 6(2)(e) of the SoPs for Tooth Wear already state that they do not apply to minor tooth wear that is confined to the enamel. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 </span>(VEA) separately defines the process to be taken to assess a condition for which there is no applicable SoP. In such cases, it is necessary to consider whether it constitutes an injury or disease and the decision-maker must determine the claim based on the totality of the available evidence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">SoPs are determined by the RMA, which is an independent expert body. The RMA has a specific role set out in section 196B of the VEA, which is limited to determining SoPs, or making decisions not to produce SoPs, on the basis of sound medical-scientific evidence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Neither the Parliament, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, nor DVA have the power to direct the RMA to include or exclude provisions in the individual SoPs which it produces. The provisions of the VEA are specifically designed to safeguard the RMA's ability to carry out its functions independently.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consequently, it is not possible to take the actions requested by the petitioners requiring the RMA to include within the SoPs information about lodging claims for minor tooth wear, nor, as noted above, is such change necessary given the provisions within the relevant SOP and the VEA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However it is important to note that the Albanese Labor Government is simplifying and harmonising Australia's veterans' rehabilitation and compensation system -with new legislation introduced into the Parliament on 3 July 2024. Under the Veterans' Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024 (the Bill), all new compensation claims from 1 July 2026 will be dealt with under a single piece of legislation—an improved Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (MRCA)—regardless of when or where the veteran served.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This is another important step in our Government's response to the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide's Interim Report and is the result of significant community consultation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge that not everyone will share the same opinion about the Government's decisions or policy approaches. However I consider it important that everyone has an opportunity to have their say about the issues that matter to them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you, and the petitioners, for taking the time to bring this matter to my attention. I trust this information is of assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours faithfully,</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 30 May 2024 regarding the two petitions, reference numbers PN0603 and EN5968, presented in the House of Representatives relating to making Motor Neurone Disease (MND) notifiable. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Notifiable Disease List (NNDL) is a legislative instrument under the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Health Security Act 2007. </span>The Australian Government Minister for Health may vary the NNDL (add or delete a disease) following consultation with the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and each state and territory Health Minister. Temporary additions may also be made by the Minister without consultation, but are only considered for public health emergencies, most recently COVID-19 and Mpox.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For status as a nationally notifiable disease to have any practical effect, the disease must be notifiable in the states and territories, as this will provide the basis for laboratories and state and territories to collect the information under jurisdictional public health legislation. At this stage MND is not notifiable in any state or territory. The critical points to note are that:</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) jurisdictional representatives need to agree unanimously that an assessment panel is required and even if the assessment panel recommend listing, they also need to unanimously support listing for it to progress further;</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the panel criteria are skewed towards communicable diseases with distinct public health action as that is the focus of the NNDL; and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the timeframe for listing permanently is approximately 12 months and each new listing typically starts from 1 January to ensure a full year of data are collected.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Conditions listed on the NNDL are also notified by the states and territories through to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS). The NNDSS is a de-identified database designed to capture only acute data for the purposes of public health response (e.g. COVID-19, salmonellosis, syphilis etc). Listing would indeed ensure all cases nationally are notified, but the exposure data captured is limited and it cannot store the sort of longitudinal data that would be required for a MND Register.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If you would like to nominate MND for assessment, please write to the Commonwealth CDNA representative Ms Emma Denehy at the email address Emma.Denehy@health.gov.au outlining your reasons for nominating MND, and how these reasons are informed by the NNDL criteria, and this nomination will progress through to the CDNA for consideration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has allocated $550,000 to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare to report on neurological conditions more comprehensively. This funding will be used to create a specialized dashboard for monitoring the prevalence and impact of several conditions, including MND, and to establish a system for updating data regularly.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 14 May 2024 regarding petition EN5972 on the implementation of nuclear power in Australia. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-style:italic;">
                </span>The Australian Government has no plans to change the longstanding moratorium on nuclear power in Australia, which is prohibited by law under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In countries with established nuclear power industries, nuclear power can provide a low emissions alternative to fossil fuels. In the context of our own clean energy transformation, the high cost and long deployment time of nuclear power makes it an unviable choice for Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The GenCost 2023-24 report, prepared by the CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), shows that renewables remain the cheapest form of generation for Australia, even when additional costs for storage and new transmission are included. Renewable technologies are quicker to build and cheaper to operate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Putting downwards pressure on electricity prices is why we are focused on transforming our electricity system so that more renewable energy powers our homes. Under the Government's Powering Australia plan, we are investing $20 billion to upgrade Australia's electricity grid, and delivering an expanded Capacity Investment Scheme to deliver 32 GW of renewable capacity by 2030. We are also investing $100 million in solar banks and $200 million in new community batteries to help more people access solar and maximise the benefits of Australia's energy transformation.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 14 May 2024 regarding Petition EN5983 about the operation of the Shincheonji Church in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is home to a diversity of faiths and all Australians are free to choose their religion, and are entitled to express and practice their religion and their beliefs, without intimidation and without interference, as long as those practices are within the framework of Australian law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While I understand the concerns raised in the Petition, section 116 of the Australian Constitution prevents the Commonwealth from passing laws establishing any religion, imposing any religious observance or prohibiting the free exercise of religion.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Should the actions of the church breach any criminal laws, investigation of any alleged crime is generally a matter for policing authorities. If there are concerns about alleged criminal activity, evidence should be provided to local state or territory police. Police operate independently of government and the decision whether or not to investigate an alleged offence is a matter for their determination.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government believes that no Australian should be discriminated against because of who they are or what they believe and will continue to seek to enhance protections in anti-discrimination law in a way that brings Australians together.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance. </span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 May 2024 and for enclosing Petition EN5996, with 63 signatures, concerning the issue of political interference mentioned in the 2024 Director-General of Security's (Director-General) Annual Threat Assessment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Director-General confirmed on 29 February 2024, that it is the longstanding practice of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to not publicly discuss individuals or to provide operational details. The Director-General outlined multiple reasons for this, including the need to protect sources and capabilities. The Director-General has also confirmed that the individual is no longer a security concern and that the matter was appropriately dealt with at the time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Espionage and foreign interference is now Australia's principal security concern. The intent of the Director-General's 2024 Annual Threat Assessment is to raise awareness of these threats, including attempts to interfere in our democratic processes. It is important Australians know how to recognise these threats to ensure they can resist and report them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN5996 to my attention. </span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 14 May 2024 regarding petition number EN6020, about increasing production of lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate that the petitioners are very concerned about availability of Vyvanse and that many Australians have been affected by recent shortages of this medicine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I assure you that managing medicine supply is a priority for the Australian Government. The Government recognises the importance of a reliable supply of essential medicines, including Vyvanse, and continuously works with pharmaceutical companies (known as sponsors) to help facilitate supply and minimise the effects of shortages on patients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration {TGA), which is part of the Department of Health and Aged Care, actively monitors the supply of medicines in Australia. While it is not responsible for coordinating the actual supply of medicine, the TGA gathers information about anticipated and current medicine shortages and discontinuations. It undertakes a range of activities to anticipate, monitor and resolve supply disruptions and communicate timely information to affected stakeholders, including patients and health professionals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Actions the TGA can undertake to reduce the impact of medicine shortages include approving the supply of suitable overseas-registered alternative medicines (which it did to help increase supply during this shortage), and working with sponsors to minimise regulatory barriers that may delay the supply of medicines. However, it is important to understand that the Government cannot compel a sponsor to register, market or manufacture a medicine in Australia, or to direct supply from other markets to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, medicine shortages are not unique to Australia. They occur for many reasons and sometimes cannot be avoided. In the case of Vyvanse, the sponsor, Takeda Pharmaceuticals Australia (Takeda), advised the TGA that the shortages were due to manufacturing issues, and that the limits imposed by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency on lisdexamfetamine supply referred to in the petition were not the cause.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Takeda notified the TGA at the end of April 2024 that shortages of all strengths were resolved. However, Vyvanse 20 mg capsules have since returned to shortage (expected to be resolved on 21 August 2024), while the 60 mg capsules are expected to be in shortage between 30 August and 21 October 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Resolution of a shortage means that the sponsor has sufficient stock of their medicine to meet the usual national demand and is available to be released to wholesalers. However, during these shortages, many people were prescribed alternative strengths. The increased demand for different strengths may cause some further supply disruptions, which may continue for some time until people are able to return to their original prescription. The TGA is continuing to work with Takeda and wholesalers to help facilitate efficient and equitable distribution of stock across Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Up-to-date and detailed information about the shortages of Vyvanse is available on the TGA website at www.tga.gov.au/vyvanse-shortage.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Petitioners also specifically requested regulatory reforms to remove barriers for generic alternatives to Vyvanse, and for the Government to place similar medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding generic alternatives, the TGA registered a generic brand of lisdexamfetamine (Actavanz) in January 2024. However, it is not currently supplied, as Takeda holds the patent for the manufacture and supply of lisdexamfetamine in Australia and it does not expire until July 2028. The Australian patent differs from the patent in the United States, which expired in August 2023. Currently patents are required to be registered separately in each country arid they are subject to the individual conditions of that country. Generic market entry often coincides with the expiry of the compound patent. Generic companies may seek to enter the market sooner by challenging the validity of patents covering the relevant product in court.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding PBS subsidy, I appreciate concerns about the high cost of the overseas-registered alternative products (those approved for temporary supply under section 19A of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Therapeutic Goods Act 1989). </span>To list a medicine on the PBS (including a medicine supplied under section 19A), the sponsor needs to submit a formal request to the Government. This request is then considered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), which is an independent expert body that advises the Government about the listing of medicines on the PBS. The Government cannot list a medicine on the PBS unless the PBAC makes a recommendation in favour of it. Importantly, sponsors make their own decisions about whether or not to apply for PBS listing and the Government cannot compel them to do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 14 May 2024 regarding petition number EN6029 requesting to provide the Karratha/Pilbara region with an inpatient/outpatient mental health facility. The petition also requested adequate psychiatric professionals be based residentially for consistent ongoing care for both youth and adults experiencing mental-ill health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am sorry to learn of the loss of Mr Machlan Felix. The Australian Government recognises the impact that suicide has on individuals, families and communities and is committed to developing a more effective mental health system that prevents suicide and improves the lives of all Australians with or at risk of mental illness.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Specialist services for people experiencing acute mental ill-health are generally funded and delivered by state and territory governments. The Western Australian (WA) Government is responsible for public hospital systems, including planning and delivering clinically necessary inpatient and outpatient services. I understand that Mr Felix's family has also started a petition urgently calling for the WA Government to establish a residential mental health facility in Karratha for those in acute need and that this was tabled in state parliament in April 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also recognises that the mental health workforce is critical to the delivery of high-quality mental health services. Under the National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Agreement (National Agreement), all governments have agreed to work together to build a mental health and suicide prevention workforce that is culturally safe and responsive to changing needs. The National Agreement also includes a commitment for all governments to implement the National Mental Health Workforce Strategy 2022-2032 (Strategy).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Strategy provides a roadmap to build a sustainable workforce that is skilled, well- distributed and supported to deliver mental health treatment, care and support that meets current and future needs. The Government is working with all state and territory governments, alongside First Nations and Lived Experience representatives, to guide implementation of the Strategy through the National Mental Health Workforce Working Group (Working Group).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ensuring Australians can access high-quality mental health care is a priority for the Government and the 2023-24 Budget provided $109.1 million to increase the availability and capability of our mental health workforce. This investment addresses critical shortages in the psychology workforce by providing additional postgraduate psychology places, internships and supervisor training places, and upskills the broader health workforce in mental health to alleviate system pressure. These measures will help address critical workforce shortages and prevent gaps in services from widening while the Government pursues long-term solutions to structural issues within the mental health system across different professions and programs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also committed to addressing the challenges faced by the psychiatry profession, including acute workforce shortages. It is recognised that these shortages have an impact on access to care and services. There are a number of investments in place to support the growth of the psychiatry workforce across a range of settings. The Government is investing an additional $40.5 million over four years (2021-22 to 2025-26) to increase the psychiatry workforce through the Psychiatry Workforce Program (PWP). A key objective of the PWP is to increase the psychiatry workforce in rural and remote areas across Australia. This includes funding to support up to 30 Full-Time Equivalent training posts per year and development of a Certificate of Psychiatry to broaden the skillsets of GPs and other medical practitioners to confidently deliver higher levels of mental health care in a range of health settings.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 14 May 2024 regarding the petition to allow for a myxomatosis vaccine to be used in pet rabbits in Australia (Petition EN6031).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that pet rabbits are much loved members of many Australian families, and with no effective treatment for myxomatosis, I understand the distress that this disease causes rabbit owners.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Unfortunately, there are no vaccines registered for use in Australia for protecting pet rabbits against myxomatosis. The myxomatosis vaccines that have been available overseas are live attenuated vaccines (also known as 'modified live' vaccines). As the virus in these types of vaccines maintains its infectivity to stimulate an immune response, there is a potential risk that the vaccine virus may spread from vaccinated pet rabbits into the wild rabbit population. The live vaccine virus could be transmitted between rabbit populations, increasing the immunity of wild rabbits to myxomatosis, and leading to an increase in their population numbers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Wild rabbits are one of Australia's most serious feral pest animals. They have been implicated in broad scale land degradation, the near-extinction or extinction of small native mammals and plants and are a food source that maintains populations of other introduced pests. However, feral animal control is complex and many factors—including technical, environmental, social and animal welfare issues—must be considered when developing appropriate policies and solutions. Biological control agents are a necessary option for controlling some feral animal species so that native biodiversity can be protected. In the case of wild rabbits, the myxoma virus remains an important measure in keeping their numbers under control.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Work previously undertaken by the Centre for Invasive Species Solutions and CSIRO identified alternative myxomatosis vaccines that may be suitable for use in Australia, however, these vaccines have not been developed beyond the experimental stage. If a vaccine was successfully developed, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority would require the vaccine manufacturer to apply to register the product for use in Australia. It is up to vaccine manufacturers to decide whether it is commercially viable for them to engage in the registration process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I realise that this is disappointing for pet rabbit owners, but I hope that they can understand that for now, protecting domestic rabbits from myxomatosis in Australia must be done by means other than vaccination. I encourage them to seek veterinary advice on how to protect their pet rabbit from this disease, in particular protection from mosquitos and fleas as these insects transmit the myxoma virus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for raising this matter with me. </span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">National Security</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for providing me the petition presented to the House of Representatives regarding the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap and other joint and collaborative facilities in Australia. I appreciate the concerns raised by Mr Drew Armstrong on this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's strategic circumstances are the most complex and challenging they have been since the end of the Second World War. Australia's Alliance with the United States is fundamental to our national security and the Australian Defence Force's ability to generate, sustain and project credible military capability.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our cooperation with international partners, including the United States, is managed through robust policy frameworks and principles that maintain and protect our sovereignty. These frameworks govern the activities of foreign governments in, from or through Australia. They also guide how we partner together to conduct activities and acquire capabilities in line with Australia's national interests.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government carefully manages all foreign defence force access, posture and training on Australian territory by ensuring all such activities align with Australia's national interests and preserve Australia's sovereign decision-making. These decisions are not dictated by the interests of other nations—rather they are mutually agreed activities in the interests of both countries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These activities only occur at the invitation of the Australian Government with full respect for our sovereignty, and domestic and international laws. A fundamental principle underpinning these activities is the longstanding bipartisan policy of having no foreign bases on Australian sovereign territory.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's cooperation with the United States through joint and collaborative facilities, including Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap, is one of our most longstanding security arrangements. These facilities provide critical functions that directly support our national security, which we would not be able to realise by ourselves.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A fundamental element of our cooperation with the United States at these joint and collaborative facilities is our longstanding and bipartisan policy of full knowledge and concurrence, as articulated by the Hawke Government. 'Full knowledge' means Australia has a full and detailed understanding of any capability or activity with a presence on Australian territory, or making use of Australian assets. 'Concurrence' means that Australia approves of the presence of a capability or function in Australia, in support of mutually-agreed goals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These principles protect Australia's right to know, understand and agree to foreign government military and intelligence activities conducted in, from or through Australia and through the use of our assets. The mechanisms by which we achieve full knowledge and concurrence at these facilities are pragmatic—such as data sharing, and joint operations and activities. Our full knowledge and concurrence framework also evolves to ensure the activities align with our national interests and the maintenance of our sovereignty.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Given their continued contribution to the security of Australia and our region, there are no plans to close joint and collaborative facilities in Australia, including Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap. As articulated in my February 2023 Statement to Parliament on Securing Australia's Sovereignty, I am assured that the Australian Government maintains appropriate levels of oversight for the activities undertaken at these facilities and that those activities are in Australia's national interests.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Mr Armstrong's petition to my attention. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 14 May 2024 to the Minister for Industry and Science, the Hon Ed Husic MP, regarding petition EN6055 to introduce laws to protect the public from current and emerging communication technologies and remote neuromonitoring. As privacy issues fall within my po1tfolio responsibilities as the Attorney-General, your email was refe1Ted to me for reply.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Privacy Act 1988 </span>(Privacy Act) regulates the collection, use, disclosure and storage of individuals' personal information. The Privacy Act contains 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) which apply to 'APP entities', including Australian Government agencies and private sector organisations with an annual turnover of more than $3 million. Neurotechnology often involves the collection of sensitive personal information, which has a higher level of protection under the Privacy Act than other personal information. The Attorney-General's Department commenced a comprehensive review of the Privacy Act in October 2020 and the Government released the Privacy Act Review Rep01t in February 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Privacy Act Review considered the privacy landscape in Australia, and identified a number of risks and opp01tunities associated with the widespread adoption of new technologies. Feedback to the Review made it clear that the Privacy Act has not kept pace with technological advancements and that reform is needed. On 28 September 2023 the Government released its response to the Privacy Act Review Report, which agreed or agreed in-principle to progress 106 proposals for reform. The Government is committed to ensuring the Privacy Act is fit-for¬ purpose in the digital age and protects individuals from harmful practices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government response to the Privacy Act Review Rep01t agreed that individuals should have greater transparency and control over their personal information. In particular, the Government agreed in-principle that entities should be required to ensure all collections, uses and disclosures of personal information are fair and reasonable in the circumstances. Introducing a 'fair and reasonable' test will help protect individuals from unexpected and harmful information-handling practices. This requirement would apply even if an individual had consented to their personal information being collected, use or disclosed for a particular purpose, to protect individuals from being nudged towards consenting to more privacy intrusive practices or selecting more privacy intrusive settings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is a clear need for privacy reform, and the Government is committed to updating the Privacy Act for all Australians.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government does not provide financial or military aid to Israel, either directly or indirectly via other countries. Australia has also not supplied weapons or ammunition to Israel since the conflict began and for at least the past five years.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I know the conflict in the Middle East is deeply distressing for many Australians, including the many Australians with a connection to the region and loved ones directly impacted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The widespread human suffering we are witnessing in Gaza is completely unacceptable. This cannot continue. This war must end.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While Australia is not a central player, we have a respected voice and we are using it to advocate for a ceasefire, the protection of civilians, increased humanitarian assistance and the release of hostages.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia continues to support the international community's response to the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Since October, Australia has committed $72.5 million to address urgent needs arising from the conflict in Gaza and the protracted refugee crisis in the region. This includes our commitment in June this year of an additional $10 million through the World Food Programme to provide life-saving food assistance to civilians in Gaza at risk of famine.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN6080, requesting legislation to ensure software sold in Australia remains in a functional state after the end of the product's support period. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, businesses are generally free to set the terms and conditions for the products they sell. For digital products such as video games, consumers often purchase a licence to use the product and do not have direct ownership over that product. This means that consumers' rights in relation to digital products are primarily governed by the terms and conditions set by the businesses in the associated licencing agreement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Terms and conditions in licencing agreements are subject to the statutory protections in the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). Under the ACL businesses are prohibited from engaging in unconscionable, misleading or deceptive conduct. The ACL also prohibits businesses from making false or misleading representations about the goods or services they sell, and from including unfair terms in their licencing agreements where these are standard form contracts.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 3 June 2024 in relation to petition EN6101. This petition appears to be based on misinformation circulating in social media that asserts the United Nations (UN) is seeking to expose young children to sexually explicit material.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The World Health Organization (WHO) and other UN specialised agencies issue technical guidance, norms and standards to support Member States to effectively address health issues, including sexual and reproductive health and rights. Australia is supportive of the UN's work to advance universal access to quality, accurate, and comprehensive sexuality education, consistent with our commitment to human rights and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">UN agencies that develop technical guidance on comprehensive sexuality education are strong advocates for the rights of children, including promoting young people's rights to education, health and wellbeing; and protecting children from violence, coercion and exploitation. UN technical guidance on comprehensive sexuality education is age- and developmentally appropriate, responding to the changing needs and capabilities of the child and the young person as they grow. This technical guidance is not legally binding. Member States may choose to apply it according to their national circumstances.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Medicare</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 3 June 2024 regarding Petition Number EN6102—request to increase the Medicare benefit for psychology sessions to a minimum of 20 sessions per year for individuals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Better Access initiative eligible people can receive a Medicare benefit for up to ten individual and ten group allied mental health services each calendar year. In 2020, an additional ten individual sessions were temporarily made available in response to the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The additional ten sessions ceased as planned on 31 December 2022.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In August 2021the Department of Health and Aged Care commissioned the University of Melbourne to complete an evaluation of the Better Access initiative, with the evaluation's final report published in December 2022. More information can be found on the department's website at www.health.gov.au by searching 'Evaluation of the Better Access initiative—final report'. While the evaluation recommended reinstating the additional 10 sessions, it also showed the number of new people accessing Better Access reduced while the additional 10 sessions were in effect.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Increasing session numbers as part of a tiered model of treatment carries a high-risk of further entrenching inequities. The evaluation found that providing additional services to existing consumers limited the capacity of providers to offer treatment to new users, with many people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and regional, rural and remote areas missing out. Since the additional Better Access sessions ceased on 31 December 2022, 44,927 additional people entered the program and used the initial 10 Better Access individual treatment sessions in 2023, compared to 2022 figures.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to a whole-of-system approach to mental health reform. The Government is investing in complementary models to deliver more care more fairly and efficiently to those who need it. In the 2024-25 Budget, the Government has invested $361million in the mental health and suicide prevention system. This investment shifts away from the one-size-fits-all approach and will relieve pressure on the Better Access initiative.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is rolling out a national network of 61 Medicare Mental Health Centres (building on the existing Head to Health services) to provide free community-based services for people with moderate to complex needs. While not intended to provide ongoing care, the number of sessions provided to consumers are not capped. A further $29.9 million over four years from 2024-25 will be provided to strengthen the clinical capacity of centres to safely and appropriately support people with severe and complex needs. This includes through a phased adoption of minimum workforce requirements and free telehealth access to psychologists and psychiatrists as part of a multidisciplinary team.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">People can find information on their nearest Medicare Mental Health Centre on the Head to Health website at www.headtohealth.gov.au/head-to-health-services or via free call on 1800 595 212 (between 8:30am and 5:00pm weekdays).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is providing $71.7 million over four years from 2024-25 to Primary Health Networks to design and deliver multidisciplinary care for people with severe or complex needs in general practices and other primary care settings. Multidisciplinary teams of social workers, counsellors, peer workers and other mental health workers will provide free wraparound support to patients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will also update guidance to better support people with chronic mental health conditions and complex needs who are accessing clinical treatment through Better Access to access additional multidisciplinary care through Medicare Benefits Schedule Chronic Disease Management items. Under a Chronic Disease Management Plan, patients can access five sessions delivered by a broader range of allied health professionals including dieticians, exercise physiologists and mental health nurses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The new National Early Intervention Service will complement Better Access and improve the availability of services at all levels of the stepped care continuum. Lower intensity services can form part of a broader treatment package for people with higher level needs and assist GPs to manage patients with higher level mental health needs in between or while waiting for clinical treatment, specialist care, or where people are reluctant to access higher intensity services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email referring petition number EN6105, regarding the Ambassador of Israel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I know the conflict in the Middle East is deeply distressing for many Australians, including the many Australians with a connection to the region and loved ones directly impacted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The widespread human suffering we are witnessing in Gaza is completely unacceptable. This cannot continue. This war must end.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While Australia is not a central player, we have a respected voice and we are using it to advocate for a ceasefire, the protection of civilians, increased humanitarian assistance and the release of hostages.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia continues to support the international community's response to the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Since October, Australia has committed $72.5 million to address urgent needs arising from the conflict in Gaza and the protracted refugee crisis in the region. This includes our commitment in June this year of an additional $10 million through the World Food Programme to provide life-saving food assistance to civilians in Gaza at risk of famine. This is in addition to Australia's annual core funding of $20.6 million for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice and our vote in international institutions and forums. In December, Australia voted with 152 countries for a ceasefire at the United Nations, and we support the ceasefire proposal endorsed by the UN Security Council in June this year. We want to see it fully implemented by both parties. Any delay will only see more lives lost.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I have also pressed for a ceasefire, protection of civilians, humanitarian aid and the release of hostages through persistent and extensive engagement with foreign counterparts, including during my visit to the Middle East, as well as with partners in Europe, Canada, Japan, the UK, the US and in our region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have pressed the Netanyahu Government directly, as have Government officials in Canberra and in Israel. We continue to make clear Australia's objection to Israel's operation in Rafah and our expectation that Israel act in accordance with international humanitarian law. We have been clear with Israel that it must comply with the binding orders of the International Court of Justice, including to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance at scale. The Australian Government is denying anyone identified as an extremist settler a visa to travel to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are pressing countries with influence over Hamas, to help secure the immediate and unconditional release of remaining hostages. We remain unequivocal in our condemnation of Hamas's horrific terror attacks of 7 October 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We have adopted the most supportive position on recognition of any Australian government in history. We support recognition of a Palestinian state as a part of a peace process. And we are taking actions to make that possible. We want the legitimate aspirations of Palestinians to be realised—because a two-state solution is necessary for a just and enduring peace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In May, Australia supported expanded Palestinian rights to participate in UN forums and the General Assembly's aspiration for eventual Palestinian membership of the United Nations, consistent with a two-state solution. Alongside key partners, we are looking at how we can support reform of the Palestinian Authority so that it can deliver on the needs of the Palestinian people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a long-standing relationship with Israel. Australia maintains diplomatic relations with many countries because it is in our national interests to do so, even where we do not agree with everything those countries do. More than 160 countries maintain diplomatic relations with Israel, enabling advocacy for a just and enduring peace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This devastating crisis demonstrates the need for a political solution to the long running Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Australia remains steadfast in our support for a two-state solution—a Palestinian state and the State of Israel, living side by side in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring petition number EN6106 regarding the ongoing Hamas-Israel conflict and related matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The widespread human suffering we are witnessing in Gaza is completely unacceptable. This cannot continue. This war must end.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While Australia is not a central player to the conflict, we have a respected voice and we are using it to advocate for a ceasefire, the protection of civilians, increased humanitarian assistance and the release of hostages.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia continues to support the international community's response to the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Since October, Australia has committed $72.5 million to address urgent needs arising from the conflict in Gaza and the protracted refugee crisis in the region. This includes our commitment in June this year of $10 million through the World Food Programme to help provide life-saving food assistance to civilians in Gaza at risk of famine. Australia also provides annual core funding of $20.6 million for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice and our vote in international institutions and forums. In December, Australia voted with 152 countries for a ceasefire at the United Nations, and we support the ceasefire proposal endorsed by the UN Security Council in June this year. We want to see it fully implemented by both parties. Any delay will only see more lives lost.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have pressed for a ceasefire, protection of civilians, humanitarian aid and the release of hostages through persistent and extensive engagement with foreign counterparts, including during my visit to the Middle East, as well as with partners in Europe, Canada, Japan, the UK, the US and in our region.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has also made clear that we respect the independence of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the critical role it plays in upholding international law and the rules¬ based order. We have been clear with Israel that it must comply with the binding orders of the International Court of Justice, including to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance at scale.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We have adopted the most supportive position on recognition of any Australian government in history. Labor will recognise Palestine—we will do this when our act of recognition meaningfully contributes to a peace process. The grave situation that Palestinians face needs more than symbolism -Australia is working with other countries to make statehood a reality. The only way to achieve a lasting peace is a two-state solution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government has strengthened Australia's opposition to Israeli settlements by affirming they are illegal under international law and a significant obstacle to peace. We remain deeply concerned by settler violence against Palestinians, which only serves to inflame tensions and undermine stability at this delicate time. The Australian Government will deny anyone identified as an extremist settler a visa to travel to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government does not provide financial or military aid to Israel, either directly or indirectly via other countries. Australia has also not supplied weapons or ammunition to Israel since the conflict began and for at least the past five years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has a contract with Hanwha Defence Australia, not Elbit Systems. The Australian Government contracted Hanwha Defence Australia in December 2023 to deliver and support infantry fighting vehicles for the Australian Army. Hanwha subsequently awarded a contract to Elbit Systems to manufacture the turret for the Australian infantry fighting vehicles. The Australian Government has no direct relationship with Elbit with respect to this contract. It was a commercial decision made by Hanwha and reflects a commercial relationship between Hanwha and Elbit. The components manufactured under this contract are solely for Australian needs, not for export elsewhere.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This devastating crisis demonstrates the need for a political solution to the long running Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israelis and Palestinians want and deserve to live their lives in peace, security and dignity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">A Digital ID is simply an online method of confirming your ID that does not require physical documents once it's set up. It works by verifying your existing ID documents such as a passport or driver license against the official record held by government.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of a Digital ID is to reduce the amount of information that businesses and government need to hold that can be at risk of data theft. By using a Digital ID, people can avoid repeatedly sharing copies of their ID documents and all the information they hold. Your information can only be shared with the service you're accessing and only with your consent. When using a Digital ID, the information that is shared when you give consent is typically your name, date of birth and email address.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 3 June 2024 enclosing Petition EN6119, with 426 signatures, concerning—Pause Immigration to Give Australia a Breather. I appreciate the opportunity to provide a response to the Committee.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government released the Migration Strategy (the Strategy) in December last year with a focus on bringing migration back to sustainable levels, while ensuring we get workers with the skills we need into the right places. The Strategy included a range of measures that are expected to halve Net Overseas Migration (NOM) by this financial year. _The Strategy aims to strengthen the integrity and quality of international education and includes policies such as higher English language and financial capacity requirements for international students, as well as measures to address education providers who seek to exploit the visa system. This Strategy is working, with visa grants for international students down by nearly 40% this year compared to last year's levels.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has secured passage of new laws for the regulation of vapes, which commenced on 1 July 2024. The new laws address the increasing health risks posed by vaping, particularly to youth and young adults, while at the same time preserving legitimate patient access to therapeutic vapes where clinically appropriate. They are necessary to promote the safe use of all vaping goods in Australia, including those for the administration of medicinal cannabis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Only vaping devices that have been notified to the Therapeutic Goods Administration under the new arrangements may be lawfully imported into Australia. From 1 July 2024, all vaping goods, including vaping devices for the administration of medicinal cannabis, must be supplied in pharmacy settings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Vaping devices that may be used for the administration of medicinal cannabis can only be lawfully supplied for use with medicinal cannabis that has been prescribed by a medical practitioner for therapeutic purposes under the special access and authorised prescriber schemes administered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. It is appropriate that these goods are supplied in pharmacy settings given the nature of the vaping substance and the mode of administration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">By limiting the supply of all vaping devices to pharmacy settings, patients who require vaping devices for legitimate therapeutic purposes can confidently purchase those devices from a pharmacist and receive information about their safe use. Limiting supply of vaping devices to pharmacy settings also assists in identifying and disrupting illicit supply of vapes by retailers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The decision whether to refuse or cancel the visa of a non-citizen who commits serious crimes or otherwise fails the character test is carefully considered, based on each individual's circumstances.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's policy though is clear, and the protection of the Australian community from harm the key priority.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring petition EN6141 regarding sanctions on Israel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I know the conflict in the Middle East is deeply distressing for many Australians, including the many Australians with a connection to the region and loved ones directly impacted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The widespread human suffering we are witnessing in Gaza is completely unacceptable. This cannot continue. This war must end.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While Australia is not a central player to the conflict, we have a respected voice and we are using it to advocate for a ceasefire, the protection of civilians, increased humanitarian assistance and the release of hostages.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia continues to support the international community's response to the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Since October, Australia has committed $72.5 million to address urgent needs arising from the conflict in Gaza and the protracted refugee crisis in the region. This includes our commitment in June this year of $10 million through the World Food Programme to help provide life-saving food assistance to civilians in Gaza at risk of famine. Australia also provides annual core funding of $20.6 million for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice and our vote in international institutions and forums. In December, Australia voted with 152 countries for a ceasefire at the United Nations, and we support the ceasefire proposal endorsed by the UN Security Council in June this year. We want to see it fully implemented by both parties. Any delay will only see more lives lost.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have pressed for a ceasefire, protection of civilians, humanitarian aid and the release of hostages through persistent and extensive engagement with foreign counterparts, including during my visit to the Middle East, as well as with partners in Europe, Canada, Japan, the UK, the US and in our region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have pressed the Netanyahu Government directly, as have Government officials in Canberra and in Israel. We continue to make clear Australia's objection to Israel's operation in Rafah and our expectation that Israel act in accordance with international humanitarian law. We have been clear with Israel that it must comply with the binding orders of the International Court of Justice, including to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance at scale. The Australian Government is denying anyone identified as an extremist settler a visa to travel to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are pressing countries with influence over Hamas, to help secure the immediate and unconditional release of remaining hostages. We remain unequivocal in our condemnation of Hamas's horrific terror attacks of 7 October 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We have adopted the most supportive position on recognition of any Australian government in history. Labor will recognise Palestine—we will do this when our act of recognition meaningfully contributes to a peace process. The grave situation that Palestinians face needs more than symbolism -Australia is working with other countries to make statehood a reality. The only way to achieve a lasting peace is a two-state solution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In May, Australia supported expanded Palestinian rights to participate in UN forums and the General Assembly's aspiration for eventual Palestinian membership of the United Nations, consistent with a two-state solution. Alongside key partners, we are looking at how we can support reform of the Palestinian Authority so that it can deliver on the needs of the Palestinian people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with longstanding practice, the Government does not speculate publicly on whether sanctions will be applied. In pressing for change, we have to consider the full range of tools we have available—diplomacy and dialogue, working in coalitions, multilateral forums, and public statements. Sanctions are not our only choice in responding to a situation of international concern, and they will rarely be our first choice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This devastating crisis demonstrates the need for a political solution to the long running Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia remains steadfast in our support for a two-state solution—a Palestinian state and the State of Israel, living side by side in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance to the petitioners. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 24 June 2024 regarding Petition EN6152—Request to repeal the Online Safety Act 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to protecting and promoting the rights and freedoms of Australians, including freedom of speech and expression. The Government also believes that all people are entitled to respect, equality, dignity, and to be free from hatred and harassment, which undermines Australian values such as freedom of expression and inclusiveness. These principles apply to the measures we take to provide safeguards and protections in the physical environments where Australians live, work and play, and they apply equally to the online environments where Australians engage.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The benefits and harms of engaging in a physical space, compared to online, may manifest differently. However, it is the Government's responsibility to ensure that our democratic norms and values are upheld in both contexts.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">These powers enable the Commissioner to protect Australians online, while recognising and balancing freedom of speech and expression. In particular, the definition of adult cyber abuse in the Act has a high threshold.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is only when material crosses a threshold well beyond reasonable commentary or expression of opinion and into the realm of intentional, serious harm and being menacing, harassing or offensive that the Act provides a mechanism for material to be removed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There will always be a need to balance the rights of individuals online, as there are in other environments, settings and communities. The powers of the Act provide the Commissioner with a reasonable and proportionate means of improving and promoting online safety for Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Act provides mechanisms to seek the review of removal notice decisions, and is limited 'to the extent (if any) that it would infringe any constitutional doctrine of implied freedom of communication' (section 233). The Government has also brought forward an independent statutory review of operation of the Act, which is being led by Ms Delia Rickard PSM. The Terms of Reference for the review are available at www.infrastructure.gov.au/department/media/publications/terms-reference-statutory-review¬ online-safety-act-2021. I am expecting to receive a final report of the review by 31 October 2024.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for contacting me in relation to petition number EN6169, presented to the House of Representatives on 24 June 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition calls for the House to enshrine the freedom of speech and freedom of the press in the Australian Constitution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Australian Constitution does not contain any express rights to 'freedom of speech' or 'freedom of the press', the High Court has recognised an implied constitutional freedom of communication on government and political matters. This constitutional protection is essential to the proper functioning of Australia's system of democratic and representative government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The implied freedom of political communication can be limited only by laws which are proportionate to achieve a legitimate purpose, such as the protection of the community from dangers provoked by material promoting violence. The freedom of political communication is a fundamental human right enjoyed by all Australians, and all people who are in Australia. However, this right is subject to limitations that are reasonable and necessary in a free and democratic society to achieve an appropriate balance between freedom of expression and the protection of groups and individuals from offensive or harmful behaviour.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for raising this matter with me. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Occupied Palestinian Territories</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring petition EN6173 regarding recognition of a Palestinian State.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The widespread human suffering we are witnessing in Gaza is completely unacceptable. This cannot continue. This war must end.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While Australia is not a central player to the conflict, we have a respected voice and we are using it to advocate for a ceasefire, the protection of civilians, increased humanitarian assistance and the release of hostages.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia continues to support the international community's response to the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Since October, Australia has committed $72.5 million to address urgent needs arising from the conflict in Gaza and the protracted refugee crisis in the region. This includes our commitment in June this year of $10 million through the World Food Programme to help provide life-saving food assistance to civilians in Gaza at risk of famine. Australia also provides annual core funding of $20.6 million for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice and our vote in international institutions and forums. In December, Australia voted with 152 countries for a ceasefire at the United Nations, and we support the ceasefire proposal endorsed by the UN Security Council in June this year. We want to see it fully implemented by both parties. Any delay will only see more lives lost.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have pressed for a ceasefire, protection of civilians, humanitarian aid and the release of hostages through persistent and extensive engagement with foreign counterparts, including during my visit to the Middle East, as well as with partners in Europe, Canada, Japan, the UK, the US and in our region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have pressed the Netanyahu Government directly, as have Government officials in Canberra and in Israel. We continue to make clear Australia's objection to Israel's operation in Rafah and our expectation that Israel act in accordance with international humanitarian law. We have been clear with Israel that it must comply with the binding orders of the International Court of Justice, including to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance at scale. The Australian Government is denying anyone identified as an extremist settler a visa to travel to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are pressing countries with influence over Hamas, to help secure the immediate and unconditional release of remaining hostages. We remain unequivocal in our condemnation of Hamas's horrific terror attacks of 7 October 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We have adopted the most supportive position on recognition of any Australian government in history. Labor will recognise Palestine -we will do this when our act of recognition meaningfully contributes to a peace process. The grave situation that Palestinians face needs more than symbolism—Australia is working with other countries to make statehood a reality. The only way to achieve a lasting peace is a two-state solution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In May, Australia supported expanded Palestinian rights to participate in UN forums and the General Assembly's aspiration for eventual Palestinian membership of the United Nations, consistent with a two-state solution. Alongside key partners, we are looking at how we can support reform of the Palestinian Authority so that it can deliver on the needs of the Palestinian people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In support of a two-state solution, the Albanese Government strengthened Australia's opposition to Israeli settlements by affirming they are illegal under international law and a significant obstacle to peace. We remain deeply concerned by settler violence against Palestinians, which only serves to inflame tensions and undermine stability at this delicate time. The Australian Government will deny anyone identified as an extremist settler a visa to travel to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government also adopted the name of 'Occupied Palestinian Territories', consistent with the approach taken by key partners, including the UK, EU and New Zealand, as well as the United Nations and the broader international community. In addition, our Government reversed the Morrison Government's decision to recognise West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reaffirming Australia's longstanding and bipartisan position that Jerusalem is a final status issue to be resolved through negotiations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This devastating crisis demonstrates the need for a political solution to the long running Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia remains steadfast in our support for a two-state solution—a Palestinian state and the State of Israel, living side by side in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">E-Cigarettes and Vaping Products</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 June 2024 regarding petition EN6174 requesting a lift to the ban on the personal importation of vaping products, including nicotine e-liquid, and imposing quantity limits instead.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is taking clear action to reduce smoking and vaping rates through stronger legislation, enforcement, education, and support. Reforms to the regulation of vapes have been implemented progressively over 2024 to address serious harms posed by vaping. This has included amendments to the customs and therapeutic goods frameworks to introduce stronger controls on the importation of vapes. Bans on the importation of disposable single-use vapes commenced on 1 January 2024 and bans on the importation of non-therapeutic vapes commenced on 1 March 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, the personal importation scheme for therapeutic vapes under therapeutic goods legislation ceased to operate. This was necessary to address the significant abuse of the personal importation scheme in recent years, and otherwise to complement changes made under customs legislation for the lawful importation of therapeutic vapes. The changes mean that individuals can no longer import therapeutic vapes personally. Only businesses with appropriate licences and permits issued by the Office of Drug Control under customs legislation may lawfully import therapeutic vapes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These measures are necessary to promote the safe use of all vaping goods in Australia. The reforms address the increasing health risks posed by vaping, particularly to youth and young adults, while at the same time preserving the use of therapeutic vapes for smoking cessation or the management of nicotine dependence where clinically appropriate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has listened to the concerns of persons who vape and has genuinely sought to facilitate legitimate patient access. Therapeutic vapes containing nicotine must continue to be supplied under prescription by medical or nurse practitioners until 1 October 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From that time, therapeutic vapes may be supplied by pharmacists from behind the counter in pharmacies without prescription to persons aged 18 and over, where certain conditions are met, including that the vapes contain a maximum of 20mg/ml of nicotine, and the quantity does not exceed one month's supply at any one time. More information on accessing therapeutic vapes is available at www.tga.gov.au by using the search term 'Vapes: information for patients and consumers'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-style:italic;">
                </span>The Government continues to ensure that there are sufficient supports available to persons for smoking and vaping cessation. These initiatives complement other actions being taken by the Government in line with the National Tobacco Strategy 2023-2030 to reduce the rates of tobacco and e-cigarette use including stronger regulation of tobacco products under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Health (Tobacco and Other Products) Act 2023.</span></span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 June 2024 regarding petition EN6178 in which you have requested that the Australian Government liaises with Norgine Pty Ltd to ascertain whether they will consider re-introducing their product Normacol Plus Granules Carton (Normacol Plus) to the Australian market.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I can confirm that Normacol Plus was included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) as a registered complementary medicine with indications (health claims) for laxative purposes. In 2021, the pharmaceutical company that produced Normacol Plus, Norgine Pty Ltd, informed the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) that there was a shortage of this product due to a manufacturing issue, and that the issue was expected to be resolved in 2022. Ultimately however, the product was discontinued from the market and cancelled from the ARTG by the company in 2023, with Norgine Pty Ltd noting that they had made a global decision to discontinue the product.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the cancellation was a decision of the product owner, and not due to a directive by the TGA, there is unfortunately no further action that the TGA can take. The TGA does not have the legal power to compel a company to apply for the inclusion of a product in the ARTG.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Managing the impact of aircraft operations is a difficult issue.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 June 2024 regarding Petition EN6207, concerning the new Commonwealth Prac Payment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the 2024-25 Budget, the Australian Government is establishing a Commonwealth Prac Payment for eligible nursing, midwifery, teaching and social work students doing their mandatory placements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The new payment is being established in response to the Australian Universities Accord (the Accord).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Placements are an important part of qualifications for a range of professions that ensure graduates have the skills and experience to enter the workforce and translate learned theory into practice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government understands that placements can impact a student's financial wellbeing and appreciates the challenges many students experience with meeting the cost of living while studying and completing mandatory placements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While recognising other qualifications require mandatory placements, the Accord recommended the Government focus on nursing, care and teaching professions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 2023 Employment White Paper also identified those in care and teaching professions as key enablers for the economy and that unpaid placements discourage many students in care and teaching professions from enrolling and completing courses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This is the first time the Australian Government has provided financial support for mandatory placements. We are starting with students studying nursing, midwifery, teaching and social work due to significant workforce shortages that need to be addressed as a priority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Almost every Australian will interact with a nurse, midwife or teacher throughout their life, and social workers are critical to the wellbeing of vulnerable people in the Australian community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Accord is not a plan for one budget, but a blueprint for the next decade and beyond. Consideration is being given to other recommendations in the Accord, including that the Government work with tertiary education providers, state and territory governments, industry, business and unions to consider further support by employers (public and private) to mitigate the risk of financial hardship and placement poverty for students in other fields.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the above, the Government increased support available to students through Austudy, ABSTUDY, Youth Allowance and provided access to more Government Rent Assistance as part of the 2023-24 Budget. These payments support Australians of all ages to attend university to pursue their career ambitions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also announced reforms to make the Higher Education Loan Program system fairer by reducing the indexation that is applied to student loans. The proposed change to indexation is to apply the lower of the Consumer Price Index or the Wage Price Index, with effect from 1 June 2023.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Mental Health</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 June 2024 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions (Committee) regarding petition EN6209 which seeks mandatory drug and mental health rehabilitation facilities for children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges the significant impact that both mental ill-health and addiction are having on young people. I would like to reassure the Committee that the Government is reducing those impacts through targeted prevention and support programs while maintaining a balanced approach between health and justice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The conditions upon which involuntary treatment can be mandated are the responsibility of state and territory governments and differ between jurisdictions. It is important to note that evidence shows that treatment is most effective when a person is willing and engaged.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The mental health of young people is a national concern, with the prevalence of mental disorders rising by 50% since 2007, which is why young people's wellbeing remains a focus of the Australian Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The organisation headspace is a national support service for young people experiencing, or at risk of, mental ill-health. The Australian Government continues to rollout new headspace services across Australia. There are currently 161 headspace services, and this number will grow to 173 by 2025-26.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also progressing joint initiatives with state and territory governments under the National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Agreement to strengthen the headspace platform and improve service integration so young people experiencing severe and complex mental ill-health have better access to supports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Government is commissioning a sector-led consortium to co-design fit for- purpose models of care for young people to ensure they receive care appropriate to their needs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to also assure the Committee that preventing and minimising the harms associated with the use of alcohol and other drugs on individuals, families and communities remains a key priority for the Government. This approach is set out in the Government's National Drug Strategy 2017-2026 which is available on the Department of Health and Aged Care's website at www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/national-drug-strategy-2017-2026. The Strategy outlines a national commitment to harm minimisation through a balanced adoption of harm reduction strategies. Implementation of the National Drug Strategy is a shared responsibility of all Australian federal, state and territory governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is aware that young people face specific risks in relation to alcohol and other drug use. The Government has invested in education and prevention programs in secondary schools, sports clubs, online and in the community to raise awareness with young people about the dangers of drug use and risky drinking. The Government has also provided funding for numerous treatment options for young people experiencing addiction. The department provides a list of organisations, websites and services that offer drug support, counselling and information about drugs and alcohol, and this is available at www.health.gov.au/topics/drugs/drugs-contacts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Australian Government provides significant funding through Primary Health Networks (PHNs) to commission drug and alcohol treatment services nationally. PHNs are independent, not-for-profit, regionally based organisations who commission health services to meet the health care needs of their communities at a local level. More information on PHN commissioned services can be found on the department's website at www.health.gov.au/our-work/phn/your-local-PHN.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government will continue to work with PHNs, state and territory governments and the Mental Health and Alcohol and Other Drug sectors, to assist young people to access the support they need.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Covid-19: Vaccination</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 June 2024 regarding petition EN6210—vaccination mandates and Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government strongly supports immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure to reduce the impact of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2023, AstraZeneca made a decision to formally discontinue their COVID-19 vaccine, Vaxzevria, in Australia. As expected, first generation vaccines were superseded by newer vaccines targeting the strains of the virus now circulating. Australia's pandemic supply stock of Vaxzevria expired on 21 March 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Vaxzevria remained provisionally approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) until 23 April 2024 when AstraZeneca voluntarily cancelled Vaxzevria from the ARTG. This was a decision of the company, due to no current or anticipated future demand of the vaccine and follows similar business decisions made overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the petition notes, in May 2024 AstraZeneca announced that it has initiated the worldwide withdrawal of its COVID-19 vaccine. This was not a decision based on safety, rather, the company has advised this was due to a surplus of available updated vaccines since the pandemic leading to a decline in demand for its vaccine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I can assure you the safety of the Australian population has always been the Government's highest priority. For this reason, decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccines have been, and continue to be, based on the expert advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) and the TGA. The Department of Health and Aged Care acknowledges publicly available information regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine and links with a rare but serious side effect called thromboses with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA and ATAGI closely monitored the emergence of TTS, meeting regularly to consider the emergence of evidence both locally and internationally in the context of the epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic at the time and consulting with the department, the TGA and relevant specialists.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">ATAGI published several statements in line with the evolving safety situation, including information for consumers and clinicians on the significance of this condition and to be alert for the symptoms and signs of thromboses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A range of severity of illness was reported in Australia. Some cases were relatively mild, some had significant morbidity, and some were fatal. TTS was very rare. In Australia, the last case of TTS reported by the TGA was in December 202l1. At that time, the rates of TTS were estimated to be:</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">about 2 per 100,000 people vaccinated with AstraZeneca aged 60 years or older</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">about 2 to 3 per 100,000 people vaccinated with AstraZeneca under 60 years of age.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The overall case fatality rate in Australia was lower than reported internationally. This was likely due to increased detection due to increased awareness, as well as early diagnosis and treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant challenges for people across Australia, and the Government recognises the difficulties posed for communities during this time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government encourages as many Australians to be vaccinated as possible, the Government's position is that vaccination is voluntary. The Government is not responsible for any vaccine mandates. State and territory public health orders may set mandatory vaccination requirements for certain professions and the limited exemptions that apply.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the absence of public health orders setting vaccine mandates in the workplace, the way in which the risk of COVID-19 in the workplace is managed becomes a matter for each individual workplace to determine. Organisations are responsible for ensuring their health and safety policies are current and comply with all relevant legislative requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments have primary operational responsibility for emergency management and public health within their respective jurisdictions. This responsibility extends to mandating vaccines for specific cohorts of workers in specific settings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments can review their public health orders and vaccination requirements at any time without input from the Commonwealth. The Government cannot intervene or override state and territory mandates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Fair Work Ombudsman advises that employers can only require employees to be vaccinated where:</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the requirement is permitted by an enterprise agreement, other registered agreement or employment contract</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence referring petition number EN6212, regarding funding and support for Palestinians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I know the conflict in the Middle East is deeply distressing for many Australians, including the many Australians with a connection to the region and loved ones directly impacted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The widespread human suffering we are witnessing in Gaza is completely unacceptable. This cannot continue. This war must end.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While Australia is not a central player, we have a respected voice and we are using it to advocate for a ceasefire, the protection of civilians, increased humanitarian assistance and the release of hostages.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia continues to support the international community's response to the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Since October, Australia has committed $72.5 million to address urgent needs arising from the conflict in Gaza and the protracted refugee crisis in the region. This includes our commitment in June this year of $10 million through the World Food Programme to help provide life-saving food assistance to civilians in Gaza at risk of famine. Australia also provides annual core funding of $20.6 million for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice and our vote in international institutions and forums. In December, Australia voted with 152 countries for a ceasefire at the United Nations, and we support the ceasefire proposal endorsed by the UN Security Council in June this year. We want to see it fully implemented by both parties. Any delay will only see more lives lost.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have pressed for a ceasefire, protection of civilians, humanitarian aid and the release of hostages through persistent and extensive engagement with foreign counterparts, including during my visit to the Middle East, as well as with partners in Europe, Canada, Japan, the UK, the US and in our region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have pressed the Netanyahu Government directly, as have Government officials in Canberra and in Israel. We continue to make clear Australia's objection to Israel's operation in Rafah and our expectation that Israel act in accordance with international humanitarian law. We have been clear with Israel that it must comply with the binding orders of the International Court of Justice, including to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance at scale.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are pressing countries with influence over Hamas, to help secure the immediate and unconditional release of remaining hostages. We remain unequivocal in our condemnation of Hamas's horrific terror attacks of 7 October 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We have adopted the most supportive position on recognition of any Australian government in history. Labor will recognise Palestine—we will do this when our act of recognition meaningfully contributes to a peace process. The grave situation that Palestinians face needs more than symbolism -Australia is working with other countries to make statehood a reality. The only way to achieve a lasting peace is a two-state solution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In May, Australia supported expanded Palestinian rights to participate in UN forums and the General Assembly's aspiration for eventual Palestinian membership of the United Nations, consistent with a two-state solution. Alongside key partners, we are looking at how we can support reform of the Palestinian Authority so that it can deliver on the needs of the Palestinian people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This devastating crisis demonstrates the need for a political solution to the long running Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia remains steadfast in our support for a two-state solution—a Palestinian state and the State of Israel, living side by side in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of <span style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span>July 2024 regarding the presentation of petition number EN6218 about Evolution Support Services Pty Ltd (ESS) and associated support workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission (NDIS Commission) is an independent agency established to improve the quality and safety of supports and services provided to persons with disability under the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Monitoring and compliance are important to the NDIS Commission's work as a regulator. It is one of the ways that the NDIS Commission can encourage best practice among NDIS providers and manage risk to NDIS participants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS Commission works with NDIS providers and their workers to help them comply with quality and safeguards requirements, including through education and training about their obligations. The NDIS Commission also investigates complaints and reports of non-compliance with the NDIS Practice Standards, NDIS Code of Conduct and other quality and safeguards requirements where they apply. This includes unregistered providers' compliance with the NDIS Code of Conduct.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The compliance and enforcement actions available to the NDIS Commission are:</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">court-based (these actions include injunctions, taking action to enforce an undertaking, and civil penalties).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Administrative measures may enable earlier resolution than court action and may also lend themselves to achievement of appropriate and timely outcomes that are in a participant's and/or provider's interests, and/or the public interest.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I can confirm the NDIS Commission is aware of the matter raised in petition EN6218 and issued a comprehensive, 3-year Compliance Notice to Evolution Support Services PTY LTD in September 2023. The Commission has also taken action against Mark Hutton, permanently banning him from being involved in providing NDIS supports and services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS Commission is monitoring Evolution Support Services improvement activities and has received reports from an independent investigator and a behaviour support adviser. The NDIS Commission is satisfied with the progress that has been made so far.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS Commission will continue to meet regularly with the ESS management team and undertake site visits to check on service quality and participants' safety and to monitor progress against all requirements of the Compliance Notice.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Occupied Palestinian Territories</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for sharing Petition EN6220 regarding a ceasefire in the Hamas-Israel conflict.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I know the conflict in the Middle East is deeply distressing for many Australians, including the many Australians with a connection to the region and loved ones directly impacted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The widespread human suffering we are witnessing in Gaza is completely unacceptable. This cannot continue. This war must end.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While Australia is not a central player, we have a respected voice and we are using it to advocate for a ceasefire, the protection of civilians, increased humanitarian assistance and the release of hostages.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia continues to support the international community's response to the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Since October, Australia has committed $72.5 million to address urgent needs arising from the conflict in Gaza and the protracted refugee crisis in the region. This includes our commitment in June this year of an additional $10 million through the World Food Programme to provide life-saving food assistance to civilians in Gaza at risk of famine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice and our vote in international institutions and forums. In December, Australia voted with 152 countries for a ceasefire at the United Nations, and we support the ceasefire proposal endorsed by the UN Security Council in June this year. We want to see it fully implemented by both parties. Any delay will only see more lives lost.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have pressed for a ceasefire, protection of civilians, humanitarian aid and the release of hostages through persistent and extensive engagement with foreign counterparts, including during my visit to the Middle East, as well as with partners in Europe, Canada, Japan, the UK, the US and in our region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have pressed the Netanyahu Government directly, as have Government officials in Canberra and in Israel. We continue to make clear Australia's objection to Israel's operation in Rafah and our expectation that Israel act in accordance with international humanitarian law. We have been clear with Israel that it must comply with the binding orders of the International Court of Justice, including to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance at scale.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are pressing countries with influence over Hamas, to help secure the immediate and unconditional release of remaining hostages. We remain unequivocal in our condemnation of Hamas's horrific terror attacks of 7 October 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We have adopted the most supportive position on recognition of any Australian government in history. We support recognition of a Palestinian state as a part of a peace process. And we are taking actions to make that possible. We want the legitimate aspirations of Palestinians to be realised—because a two-state solution is necessary for a just and enduring peace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In May, Australia supported expanded Palestinian rights to participate in UN forums and the General Assembly's aspiration for eventual Palestinian membership of the United Nations, consistent with a two-state solution. Alongside key partners, we are looking at how we can support reform of the Palestinian Authority so that it can deliver on the needs of the Palestinian people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government has strengthened Australia's opposition to Israeli settlements by affirming they are illegal under international law and a significant obstacle to peace. We remain deeply concerned by settler violence against Palestinians, which only serves to inflame tensions and undermine stability at this delicate time. The Australian Government will deny anyone identified as an extremist settler a visa to travel to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This devastating crisis demonstrates the need for a political solution to the long running Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia remains steadfast in our support for a two-state solution—a Palestinian state and the State of Israel, living side by side in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be useful to the petitioners.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Pensions and Benefits</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 1 July 2024, concerning the Age Pension and the Work Bonus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's social security system is a non-contributory, means tested, residence-based system, designed to provide income support to people who, for reasons such as age, unemployment or ill health, are unable to support themselves. The Age Pension is funded by taxpayers, and targeted through the means test to those who need it most.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Pensioners who are Age Pension age (67 years and above) may also access the Work Bonus, which operates in addition to the income free area. Under the Work Bonus the first $300 of work income a fortnight is not counted in the pension income test. This would allow, for example, a single age pensioner with no other income, to earn up to $512 a fortnight from work and still receive the maximum rate of the Age Pension.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Pensioners are able to build up any unused amount of the $300 fortnightly exemption in a Work Bonus income bank up to a maximum amount. This amount can be used to exempt future earnings from the pension income test, so a pensioner could earn up to this amount a year extra without it affecting their pension. The income bank amount is not time-limited- if unused it carries forward, even across years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 December 2022 pensioners who are Age Pension age (67 years and above) have also received a $4,000 up-front credit in their Work Bonus income bank, and the maximum income bank balance has increased from $7,800 to $11,800, until 31 December 2023. This means every age pensioner will be able to have an extra $4,000 of employment income disregarded from the income test from the start, rather than accumulating these credits over time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 January 2024, all new pension entrants of Age Pension age (67 years and above) will receive a $4,000 Work Bonus starting balance, and the $11,800 maximum balance will be retained for all new and existing recipients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The operation of the Work Bonus, pension income free area and taper rate means that pensioners are better off while they (or their partner) are earning income in addition to their pension payments. The design of the Work Bonus in particular recognises the substantial benefits for older Australians, and the broader community, of continuing to work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that the petition mentions an increase to the fortnightly Work Bonus amount as well as indexation of that amount in line with the Age Pension. The current settings under the Work Bonus already provide a substantial incentive for pensioners over pension age to undertake paid employment. The incentives have also increased with the recent changes the Government has implemented, as outlined above.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the petition advocates for the combining of Work Bonus balances for couples. The intention of the Work Bonus is to provide an incentive to age pensioners who can and want to continue to work. The Work Bonus recognises that continuing employment for older Australians provides financial and non-financial benefits for individuals and brings substantial benefit to the broader community. For these reasons, the Work Bonus applies to the individual work income of each pensioner. The suggestion that any unused Work Bonus balance be shared within a couple would be inconsistent with the policy intent of the initiative.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate you bringing this matter to my attention. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Whistleblower Protection</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for the referral of petition of EN6230 regarding whistleblower protections.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition asks the House of Representatives to pass legislation to protect whistleblowers, set up a body to support whistleblowers who expose wrongdoing when secret information and state security are involved, and pardon convicted whistleblowers with an apology and financial compensation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 </span>(PID Act) is an important element of the Commonwealth's integrity and transparency framework. The PID Act enables public officials to disclose suspected wrongdoing by another public official or by an Australian government agency, and requires disclosures to be properly investigated and dealt with. It also provides those public officials with the assurance that, if they make their disclosure in accordance with the requirements of the PID Act, they will be protected from reprisal action and immune from administrative, criminal and civil liability, including absolute privilege in proceedings for defamation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The PID Act provides for the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS) to receive public interest disclosures that relate to the conduct of intelligence agencies and public officials who belong to intelligence agencies. The IGIS is responsible for reviewing the activities of the Australian intelligence agencies under its jurisdiction to ensure that the agencies act legally and with propriety, comply with ministerial guidelines and directions, and respect human rights.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is delivering on its commitment to strengthen the Commonwealth public sector whistleblowing framework through a staged reform process. On 1 July 2023, priority amendments to the PID Act came into effect, which ensured immediate improvements to the public sector whistleblower framework were in place in time for the commencement of the National Anti-Corruption Commission. These reforms implemented 21 of the 33 recommendations from the 2016 Review of the PID Act by Mr Philip Moss AM (Moss Review) as well as 4 recommendations from other parliamentary committee reports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In late 2023, the Government consulted widely on a second stage of reforms, including proposals to establish a Whistleblower Protection Authority or Commissioner. The Government is considering what further reforms are required to ensure Australia's public sector whistleblowing framework remains fit for purpose and accessible for public officials to report wrongdoing. The second stage of reforms will consider the remaining recommendations of the Moss Review and other relevant reports and reviews, and is an opportunity to further improve the public sector whistleblowing framework by considering how to address the underlying complexity of the PID Act and what steps can be taken to provide effective and accessible protections to public sector whistleblowers, including where a disclosure may include classified information or intelligence information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is open to individuals who have been convicted of a Commonwealth offence to petition for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy, including by way of the grant of a pardon, a remission on sentence or a referral to a court of appeal. Pardons may be granted in rare and exceptional circumstances, and the effect is that a person is taken to never have been convicted of the offence and is immediately released.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Royal Prerogative of Mercy is exercised in relation to federal offenders by the Governor-General on my advice. Applications are made to my department, providing detailed information of the offender's case and the grounds on which the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy is sought, along with supporting information and evidence. Consistent with the policy of successive governments, a grant of a free and absolute pardon will only be recommended to the Governor-General where I am satisfied that the convicted person is morally and technically innocent of the relevant offence. This serves to maintain the integrity of the justice system and respect the separation of powers between the executive and judiciary.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It would not be appropriate for me to comment on whether or not a petition has been received from any particular individual, nor on the potential merits of a petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance. </span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Tertiary Education: Mandatory Work Placement</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence 1 July 2024 regarding Petition EN6249, concerning the new Commonwealth Prac Payment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the 2024-25 Budget, the Australian Government is establishing a Commonwealth Prac Payment for eligible nursing, midwifery, teaching and social work students doing their mandatory placements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The new payment is being established in response to the Australian Universities Accord (the Accord).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Placements are an important part of qualifications for a range of professions that ensure graduates have the skills and experience to enter the workforce and translate learned theory into practice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government understands that placements can impact a student's financial wellbeing and appreciates the challenges many students experience with meeting the cost of living while studying and completing mandatory placements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While recognising other qualifications require mandatory placements, the Accord recommended the Government focus on nursing, care and teaching professions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 2023 Employment White Paper also identified those in care and teaching professions as key enablers for the economy and that unpaid placements discourage many students in care and teaching professions from enrolling and completing courses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This is the first time the Government has provided financial support for mandatory placements. The Government is starting with students studying nursing, midwifery, teaching and social work due to significant workforce shortages that need to be addressed as a priority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Almost every Australian will interact with a nurse, midwife or teacher throughout their life, and social workers are critical to the wellbeing of vulnerable people in the Australian community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Accord is not a plan for one budget, but a blueprint for the next decade and beyond. Consideration is being given to other recommendations in the Accord, including that the Government work with tertiary education providers, state and territory governments, industry, business and unions to consider further support by employers (public and private) to mitigate the risk of financial hardship and placement poverty for students in other fields.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the above, the Government increased support available to students through Austudy, ABSTUDY, Youth Allowance and provided access to more Government Rent Assistance as part of the 2023-24 Budget. These payments support Australians of all ages to attend university to pursue their career ambitions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also announced reforms to make the Higher Education Loan Program system fairer by reducing the indexation that is applied to student loans. The proposed change to indexation is to apply the lower of the Consumer Price Index or the Wage Price Index, with effect from 1 June 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  The reason there are only two petitions being presented to the House today is that most electronic petitions that closed during the winter sittings break were presented last Monday. The two petitions presented today relate to local post offices and the services they can provide the community. One is a paper petition with over 16,000 signatures, and the other is an electronic petition with more than 7,000 signatures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased that today's report contains 55 ministerial responses to petitions. As you know, under the standing orders, once a petition is presented to the House, the committee may refer the petition to the minister responsible for the administration of the matter raised in the petition. A minister is then expected to provide the committee with a written response to the petition within 90 days. While most petitions are responded to within this period, the committee appreciates that sometimes there can be delays, particularly where an issue can touch on multiple ministerial responsibilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent weeks the committee secretariat has been in contact with some ministerial offices about responses to petitions that have been outstanding for more than 90 days. I note that some of the petitions in question were referred to ministers prior to the committee adopting a requirement for petitions to gain 50 or more signatures for referral. This means that a response is still sought for some older petitions that received a very small number of signatures. I thank the ministerial offices for their cooperation in this matter, and, as responses continue to come in, they'll be noted by the committee and presented to the House accordingly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the House.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That this bill be now read a second time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation, we used to pride ourselves on the way we treated people who needed our protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We played an active role in negotiating groundbreaking international treaties and were prepared to stand by our word: honouring the terms of the treaties we helped create.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw those who desperately boarded small vessels to escape an environment threatening their lives as people who were deserving of our compassion and respect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These people have contributed extraordinary things to our community—from sporting accolades to breakthrough achievements in art, engineering, medicine, food and politics—with this 47th Parliament benefiting from this lived experience among our MPs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet in the nineties our political leaders identified these people as a potentially powerful group of 'others' that should be used to manipulate our domestic environment and with that their attitudes hardened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A frightened population is easier to control as fear quietens people and encourages them look to their leaders for safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at that time and see if for it was and what it continues to be—a flagrant, and ultimately sadly successful, campaign that used the 'fear of others' to control us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's this fear that stops us looking too closely and convinces us to trust the things happening behind razor wire fences and bolted doors are warranted to protect our borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And our government continues to leverage this fear to enable them to completely disregard the basic human rights of a certain set of individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today my community of North Sydney and I stand with the refugee and asylum seeker communities and advocates across our country—to say 'no more'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No more will we accept propaganda that seeks to embed fear. No more will we let weak leadership continue to drag our international reputation through the mud or let leaders use words to divide us based on where we have come from, the colour of our skin or the religion we practice. No more will we let our government arbitrarily and indefinitely hold those seeking protection in endless detention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather we will reset our path and walk away from destruction, back towards basic human respect, because we are better than all of that, and we want our government to rise to meet our expectations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In presenting the Migration Amendment (Limits on Immigration Detention) Bill 2024<span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>I'm offering our current government a way to move beyond the politics of fear and division and to re-instate Australia's fundamental commitment to international humanitarian law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I originally introduced a version of this bill last year, but it was ignored by the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, we have endured another 12 months of cheap political point scoring as the major parties continue to argue that there should be no limits to what our government can do in our name, to 'protect our borders'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been 11 years since Australia restarted the offshore processing regime, declaring all who sought our protection by boat would be condemned to the uncertainty that comes with indefinite detention on Nauru, Manus Island or Papua New Guinea—irrespective of the circumstances that led to them to seek safety in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite Nauru being emptied last year, as of today, around 100 asylum seekers are indefinitely detained there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This strengthened bill then is being re-introduced in the light of those numbers and to give this government a way out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I present it, I ask that we set aside the often dubious and sometimes racist debate around asylum seekers, and instead look at this issue through a human rights lens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does not end offshore processing—nor does it say any person who comes to our country should automatically be granted residency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather it brings an end to the inhumane practice of indefinite and arbitrary detention for people seeking our protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It does this by firstly introducing a 90-day limit on immigration detention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This limit can be extended if the minister decides that, considering principles of human rights law, an extended period of detention is necessary as a last resort, reasonable, and proportionate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the bill also enables any ministerial extension to be reviewed by the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eleven years ago, the then immigration department aimed to process applications for onshore protection visas within 90 days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet right now, the average number of days people arriving as refugees or on humanitarian visas spend in detention is 1,057 days (or 2.9 years) with the longest being 5,766 days—or nearly 16 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By comparison it takes just 55 days for a claim to be processed in the USA and 14 days in Canada.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ninety days should be achievable here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, this bill prohibits the detention of children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Convention on the Rights of the Child contains numerous rights for refugee children that Australia currently blatantly denies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These include the obligation to make all decisions in the best interests of the child, to not separate children from their families, to protect children from all forms of violence or abuse, and special protections for children who are either already an established refugee or are seeking refugee status.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would also ultimately bring us back in line with several other human rights treaties that we are party to, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a signatory to these treaties we have a responsibility to protect the human rights of all seeking asylum, regardless of how they arrive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These rights are not optional. We do not get to decide when we uphold them, nor for whom and setting them aside is a dangerous notion, as evidenced by the stories told by those who have experienced Australia's detention regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One such person is now a human rights activist, and a former refugee held in Nauru. She has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">11 years ago I was locked up in Nauru and it made me sick. No privacy, no safety, I could not see my family or see any hope for the future … I was then evacuated to Brisbane where I was locked up again in detention for two more years. Locked up with my sickness and pain and separated from my family. Now I am still not free, and I am still in Australia waiting. I still can't see my family, I can't study, it is hard to find work as we have to renew our visas every three to six months. It is too much.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I acknowledge the progress we have seen, with the introduction of the new Administrative Review Tribunal due to start soon. There are many hoping to see it operating efficiently and effectively as quickly as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But ultimately our current government presides over a system that is failing to protect the basic human rights of those who need our protection the most, and we have it in our power to do better.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  I second the motion. It is just under nine months since the member for North Sydney introduced an earlier version of this bill. It was timely then and, considering the febrile state of the world, it is urgent now. Humanity should be the starting point for any conversation about war and its consequences, and indefinite detention is inhumane. So is seeking to exclude people fleeing one war zone from Australia's refugee program, as the Coalition has suggested.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the parallels with Donald Trump's toxic Muslim ban of 2017, banning people from entering the US from particular countries. I covered this when I was US Bureau Chief for the ABC, and I note Trump's more recent comments threatening to step up travel bans from so-called 'terror-plagued countries'. We must not allow this kind of rhetoric to go unchecked here in Australia. As the world's wars escalate and force people to flee to safety, we must remain clear-eyed, reasoned and empathetic, as this bill, the Migration Amendment (Limits on Immigration Detention) Bill 2024, is.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Goldstein voted for me in part because I stand for more humane treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. Most refugees are no threat to Australia. They should be treated with respect and sensitivity. It is timely to note that Australia is the nation that provided a haven for the highest concentration of Holocaust survivors in the world. The Jewish community that has since made a home in the safety of Melbourne and Sydney is something we should all be proud of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also provided a home for those fleeing wars across South-East Asia, including Cambodians who fled the horrors of the Khmer Rouge, which killed up to three million people. We welcomed people from war-torn Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine and elsewhere. The innocent civilians of Gaza should be granted entry under exactly the same terms and conditions, and that euphemistically named processing should be efficient and sensitive, reflecting respect for the situation from which they have come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite stated Labor policy, we are more than two-thirds of the way through this term of parliament, within eyesight of the next election, and still living with the stain of offshore detention on our national character. The updated bill clearly brings offshore detention within its scope, as well as reflecting developments, including the NZYQ High Court case and the establishment of the Administrative Review Tribunal. It is of profound concern that Nauru is now hosting six times more people than it did six months ago. This return to offshore detention by stealth must be stopped, and those sitting on the government benches should live up to the promise of their party platform and support this bill. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to the Murphy report's call for a total ban on gambling ads, the government is apparently set to announce partial bans—and, in the case of broadcasting, not for another two years.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was out doorknocking on the weekend; gambling ads came up repeatedly, from those who support me and from those who don't, Independent voters, Labor voters and Liberal voters who said: 'I support your stance on this. Keep going.' So I am.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, given the power and the influence of the gambling giants and their handmaidens, the broadcasters and the major sporting codes, it is quite remarkable that on this issue the Labor, coalition and crossbench representatives, including my colleague the member for Curtin, could come together to agree on a course of action reflected in the Murphy report.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would see gambling retain a place in our society but see it effectively regulated and taxed—and importantly reduce the avalanche of advertising that has seen young people targeted and groomed into believing that sport and gambling are inexorably intertwined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Analysis of AEC returns by FARE Australia shows that companies with gambling interests donated $1.58 million to the major parties in the financial year leading up to the 2022 federal election.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hughes estimates the gambling industry's entire ad spend in Australia at $275 million, with Channel Seven's revenue at most, as an example, at about $106 million—around seven per cent of its total annual revenue.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If there are steps to be taken to relieve the financial pressure on the broadcasters—for example, easing the 'spectrum' tax—then that's worth considering—not, though, as a trade-off for a ban on gambling advertising but as a measure to be considered on its own merits.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHANEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  I second the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Prohibition of Gambling Advertisements) Bill 2024. I feel deeply frustrated that it's necessary to put up a private member's bill like this one. It's not the first time the crossbench has introduced legislation on this topic, with the broad support of the community. We are fighting for ordinary Australians who love their sport against the money and power that is tipping the scales in the wrong direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By all accounts, this government may well ignore the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs inquiry which I sat on in the first year of this parliament. Our report contains unanimous recommendations on a range of gambling reforms, including a strong recommendation to phase out online gambling ads. We heard evidence from brave witnesses who told their stories of the uphill battle to avoid gambling when it's everywhere you look. We heard about the misery created by this predatory industry, relationship breakdowns, mental health issues, financial distress, suicide and family violence. We came together from across the House, including some members on my right now, to formulate unanimous recommendations which the government seems to be preparing to water down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People of all political persuasions in my community in Curtin tell me every week to keep up the good work on gambling reform. They're parents, sport lovers and people deeply, but often secretly, affected by the stigmatised harm of gambling. On Saturday, at my monthly community catch-up, a young man, Will, was telling me about the gambling harm he sees within his friend group, mates who have confided about their losses but are hounded by the ads everywhere. I meet with constituents who disagree with everything else I stand for but want to see gambling ads banned. This is an absolute no-brainer. People on both sides of the House quietly tell me to keep up the pressure. They want to see a ban, but the major political parties are held ransom to the money and power that stands to lose if we end these ads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence shows us that partial bans do not work. We already have a partial plan in place during live sports events which is entirely ineffectual. The government says we need a balanced approach. Since when did we balance the profits of harmful industries against the interests of our kids? Are we really saying: 'Okay, we need to accept that gambling will be normalised for a whole generation of kids so that sports codes are profitable or so that TV stations can be propped up'? If we are so worried about the viability of the free-to-air broadcasting industry, would we consider bringing back tobacco ads to keep it viable? This is a choice we are making, and Australians will judge this government for the choice it makes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not too late. The government can still make the right choice, show some backbone and implement a ban on gambling ads, in line with this bill. That's why I commend this bill to the House and second it. I really hope that the government is listening.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2007 the unions in this country have donated $100 million to the Australian Labor Party. One of the first actions this government took was to repay them in spades, by abolishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Bob Hawke, Kevin Rudd and even Julia Gillard knew of the need to stand up to militant unions. Those opposite cannot simply ignore the continuous succession of court judgements, the documents and the need to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2003 the CFMEU and its officials have broken workplace laws on more than 2,600 occasions, have been involved in approximately 213 proceedings and have been penalised by over $24 million in penalties by the courts. The ABCC routinely filed new court cases which called out abhorrent behaviour, with a success rate of 91 per cent. The industry watchdog had an exemplary track record in cracking down on union intimidation, thuggery and criminal behaviour in the construction sector, especially the harassment and abuse of women on job sites. It was a highly effective body, which is why John Setka wanted it abolished and why the Prime Minister willingly obliged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government continues to repay them in spades. It's business and taxpayers—they're the ones who foot the bill here. When people are paying more taxes at the moment, understand that they're going toward the CFMEU and the activities there, because, when we talk about a new stadium for the 2032 Olympics, costing $3 billion, $4 billion or—the latest proposal—$6 billion, add the 30 per cent CFMEU tax on top of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you go to build a hospital, you go to build a school or you go to build an aged-care facility, add 30 per cent on. That means that you have less capacity to build the next project. When you want to duplicate a roadway or you want to build a bridge across a river plain so that there can be the adequate infrastructure in that local community, understand that, because of this Prime Minister's actions, because of his weakness of leadership and because of the way in which he and his colleagues have facilitated the criminal activity within the CFMEU, understand that we are building less in this country than we ever have before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be building more. We know that the government has brought in a million people over the course of the last two years. We've only built 265,000 homes. And that's why this government has created a housing crisis. We have builders who are going bankrupt at a record rate. We have building costs which are escalating, and the government says, 'The CFMEU doesn't have an influence in relation to the residential sector.' Of course they do. The same subcontractors who are working on bigger sites are working on smaller sites. Builders have told this government time over that they can't retain their workforce, because people are going to work for $150,000 or $200,000 a year on a CFMEU site on a stop-and-go job, and people are paying the price for that.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government seems to think that, somehow, the activity of the CFMEU is not inflationary. It is. Why are interest rates higher here when interest rates are being reduced in the United Kingdom, in Canada and in New Zealand and are on their way down in the United States, why are they still holding high here and why is the Reserve Bank governor suggesting that the likelihood is that rates will hold where they are or perhaps go up over the course of this calendar year or early into the next calendar year? It's because of the government's spending, and it's because of the inflationary pressures in the economy. The government's energy policy has been a disaster. It's not just your power bill that's gone through the roof; it's the local farmer's, it's the local IGA store's—their cold storage means their power bill has doubled over the last couple of years. They're not absorbing that cost; they're passing it on, and that's why your grocery prices are spiking under this Prime Minister. It's why our country is heading in the wrong direction under Anthony Albanese. That's the reality for Australians. They're feeling it every day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the CFMEU has a protection racket going that is utterly and completely condoned and facilitated by this government. Now, I know there are good members of parliament in the Labor Party who privately express their dismay at this Prime Minister's actions, at the weakness of his leadership in relation to the CFMEU. In this bill we seek to restore the law of order. We seek to make sure we can have proper pricing structures in our building sector. If we do that, people will have the capacity to afford a builder again. At the moment people know, if they want to renovate or if they've got kids who want to build a new home, that it is beyond the grasp of most Australians. That is the creation of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not the only disaster they've created in just two short years, but it is a very significant one, and it's having a negative impact in relation to the economy and in particular the building sector. That is why I commend this bill to the House, and I think there should be a very robust discussion in advance. I want to thank the seconder of this bill, the member for Fisher, somebody who has very significant experience both as a builder and as a lawyer within this area of practice. He has a unique skill set and perspective, and I welcome his seconding of this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="265967" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  I second the motion. The Building and Construction Industry (Restoring Integrity and Reducing Building Costs) Bill 2024 is a no-brainer. For the Queenslanders in the House right now: do you remember that Suncorp ad where the wife is wandering around the backyard with a tea towel over her head and she says: 'Charter boat? What charter boat?'? For years the now Leader of the Opposition and I, and many other members on this side of the House, have been talking about the criminality in the building industry by the CFMEU. And the Prime Minister and the member for Watson had the audacity to say recently, 'We had no idea it was this bad.' For years, those members who have been around for a while would have heard the Leader of the Opposition talking about the CFMEU breaking arms, threatening people who were working on building sites. Well, I was one of those people who were threatened on a building site in Melbourne in the bad old days of the BF. That's why I am so exercised by this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, for those members opposite to come in here and say, 'Oh, there's nothing to see here'—as they did for so many years, and now they've had this epiphany because of some recent media that was done—is beyond galling. It is misleading, because this discussion has been had for so long and it has been brought to the attention of those opposite. Yet, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, they've taken $100 million since 2007 in political donations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those members opposite talk about how you have to operate in safe workplaces, but somehow that doesn't apply to building sites across this country. Men and women across this country—good, hardworking small-business people—go to building sites every day to put food on the table for their kids, yet they are subject to the thuggery that is going on every day in this building industry: 'If you don't pay the piper, you don't get to work here'. It's moved beyond 'no ticket, no start'. It's moved beyond 'If you don't sign up to the CFMEU, if you don't pay the piper, then you can't get a start.' It's not only that but: 'Not only will you not get a start on this job; you won't get a start on any job, on any building site in this country.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABCC will bring back a restoration of integrity to this industry, which has been so lawless for such a long time. Stephen McBurney, who used to be the commissioner—and who, full disclosure, I went to school with—is a good guy. He stood up and stood up for people in the building industry. And what has the CFMEU done? They tried to get him banned from going back to working for the AFL. That's what started all of this—the CFMEU had the audacity to pick a fight with the AFL. God knows!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition touched on the costs of construction. If I were still a chippy, and I was sitting down in the pub having a drink my mates on a Friday night, and the bloke sitting next to me tells me he's earning $200,000 on a building site, and I'm earning 40 or 50 bucks an hour on a building site, where do you reckon I'm going to go? I'm going to go to my boss and say: 'Boss, guess what I heard on Friday. You either need to start paying me more money or I am out of here. That's why we've got a construction skills shortage in this country. That's why people can't get their houses built. That's why the price of construction and housing has skyrocketed. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Fisher for his contribution. It's a practical demonstration and one that all Australians can understand. Importantly, as the member for Fisher pointed out, we're having this debate because the government is running against common sense and logic and the views of the majority of Australians. Of course, that chippy or the plumber or the electrician is going to go to the boss and say that—or he or she is going to take the job on the biggest CFMEU building site. We talk about productivity in this country, but certainly not enough. We need to have a productive economy. When people hail the reforms of the Hawke-Keating period—which was supported by John Howard in opposition—and the economic reforms of the period from 1996 to 2007 under John Howard and Peter Costello, productivity was key to many of those changes that were made to modernise our economy. It wasn't just floating of the dollar and it wasn't just the way in which our tax system operates, or that the old sales tax needed to be replaced by the GST; it was about industrial relations reform.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many good unions in this country, and they are besmirched by the activities of the lawless CFMEU. But, somehow, the CFMEU has gained legitimacy within the Australian Labor Party. They influence votes within preselections, so there are members here in the Labor Party—who have all got their heads down at the moment—who rely on delegates from the CFMEU at their conference or at preselections, and that's why they're remaining silent. Let's be very clear about it: they know firsthand what is happening within the CFMEU. They fully understand, and despite the points made by the Leader of the House, the minister knew full well what was going on here. Let's not fall for that pathetic nonsense that the first Tony Burke knew of this was—</span>

                    </a>  The first the minister for industrial relations knew of this—no, he's the new minister for immigration, and congratulations to him for being appointed to that role and cleaning up the disastrous mess left by Minister Giles—but I digress. The fact is that the minister had complete and absolute knowledge of what was happening because these matters have been before the Federal Court, as was pointed out before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that since 2003 the CFMEU and its officials have broken workplace laws on more than 2,600 occasions. That's not the record of the Health Services Union, even though they have their own problems at the moment. That's not the record of the AWU. That's not the record of other unions across the country who may from time to time inadvertently or otherwise breach the law. This is an organisation that's been described by judges in the Federal Court as having no regard for the rule of law.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet somehow the Labor Party does nothing about it. It's not just because they influence preselections and debates; it's because they donate tens of millions of dollars to this Prime Minister's party. That's what has happened here. So what justification, given that on 2,600 occasions the officials have been before the courts and been involved in about 213 proceedings and been penalised with over $24 million in penalties by the courts? How could you be blind to that? How could you pretend that that is not a reality? Well, it's because they donate money. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the Greens are silent too, I might say. The Greens political party is a very significant beneficiary of the largesse dished out by John Setka and his friends. I don't know whether any of the teals have received any money from the CFMEU. It'd be interesting to get a full understanding given how interested they are in disclosure and transparency. But ultimately whether they could talk on those issues is a decision not of theirs but of Simon Holmes a Court, but that would be interesting to understand. </span>

                    </a>  That's obviously not a point of order. As we know if we go to Victoria, where the CFMEU has its claws in deep to the Allan government, a union official on major Victorian government construction sites and senior Bandidos bike enforcer is currently charged with serious assault. The union official is currently on trial for a violent home invasion where a woman was attacked. The Fair Work Commission deemed this individual a fit and proper person on 23 June and granted him a right-of-entry permit despite it being aware of his criminal history. A union official who was a convicted drug dealer was able to obtain a right-of-entry permit, only to have it revoked when he was penalised by the court for failing to comply with that said permit. Yet still this parliament, this government, has refused to pass a law that seeks to remove these individuals from our worksites and protect people in small business when unions threaten, coerce and bully them. It has to change. There needs to be a restoration of the rule of law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why the government would abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission when it had a decent record, as we've just referred to, is because of the influence. It's because of the political influence. When we look at this government's motivations, they are motivated by only a few things. One is preferment on the unions because the unions pay millions of dollars of donations to the Labor Party. They are obsessed—particularly this Prime Minister—with an inner-city Sydney view about how he can stop the bleeding of votes to the Greens, so the motivation is what can benefit the unions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of people across the country now are rightly asking themselves what on earth is the Albanese government about? No. 1 is how can we help out the unions—not the Australian people, not people who are struggling in the suburbs at the moment with paying their bills. How can we help the unions? No. 2 is how do we stop haemorrhaging votes to the Greens? Therefore, we're driven further and further to the left on issues, including in relation to matters that are in the press at the moment in relation to migration matters et cetera. That's why they're selling out part of the community here in Australia and it's why they've made Australia less safe than what it has been in the past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Albanese government is about unions, it's about stopping votes going to the Greens, it's about making sure that they can take care of friends otherwise—and I think we'll have more to say in due course about some of the people who have been donating to the Labor Party in recent times. They're not concerned about the Australian public, who are really at odds with the government's perspective on home ownership because this government doesn't believe in making it easy for young people to buy a home. Their model is build to rent—that is built to rent for life because you're more likely to be a Labor voter if you're building to rent and you're a renter for life than you are if you are a homeowner, because you're worried about interest rates and economic management et cetera. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we're seeing in the polling now, people really understand that despite this Prime Minister's best attempts, he has no clue when it comes to economic management. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor always, always run up debt. They always have higher interest rates. They always mismanage the economy and, ultimately, unemployment goes up; inflation is sticky as it is at the moment. Interest rates are going down in New Zealand and Canada and in the United kingdom but not here, and it's because of the Labor government's mishandling of the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So they're not worried about homeownership. It's at the core of who we are, because we believe in choice. We believe in making sure that the economy works for people, not that people are working for the economy. We want to make sure that people who save and work hard keep more of their own money. That's what our coalition partners are about. That's part of our vision for our country. We want to make sure that Australians can realise the great dream of homeownership. We want to make sure that there is more prospect, but there is less prospect of homeownership when the CFMEU is running riot across building sites, whether they're industrial or commercial or, indeed, residential in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister and the weakness that he has displayed every day over the course of the last two years have resulted in the CFMEU holding this government to ransom. That's what's happened here. But the average Australian is paying the price. Taxpayers are being ripped off. Nick McKenzie, to his great credit—the work that he and others have done in the Nine Network in exposing some of this. It's just scratching the surface. There are builders and subcontractors who, when you speak to them in private, their stories are horrific: their dog at home being baited, their family being threatened. The way in which the CFMEU uses bikies, who are the biggest distributors of drugs in our country: they're enforcers. That criminal conduct that takes place is not conducive to a good building sector and one that is affordable for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the biggest rip-off of Australian taxpayers in our country 's history, and this Prime Minister continues to turn a blind eye. That's why I would encourage the House to consider this bill and to support it in due course.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate risks are a problem we are facing now. They're impacting the safety of our communities, costing ordinary Australians and fuelling inflation. Severe weather events are already costing the Australian economy over $38 billion a year, which is predicted to rise to at least $73 billion per year by 2050 if climate change continues unmitigated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in the grip of 'heatflation'; in Australia we are facing increasingly extreme events, from floods to bushfires to cyclones, damaging our homes, infrastructure and communities. Impact from extreme weather is driving insurance costs through the roof, and that is fast outpacing inflation, which in turn is fuelling the cost-of-living crisis. In Warringah, local Facebook group chats are alive with people realising that insurance premiums are up a median of 28 per cent across the board. Putting downward pressure on insurance can be achieved by investing in adaptation, but we don't hear much of that from the government and certainly not from the opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, for every $1 invested in adaptation and resilience building, we get a return of $11, yet historically there has been a 97 per cent allocation of funds to disaster recovery rather than prevention because we know that, if you under-report and underacknowledge the risks and the impact that is coming, you don't have to deal with the cause. For too long that has been the case, so I'm calling on the government to reverse this, to plan ahead, to act now, to prioritise adaptation and resilience building and to make sure we are keeping our communities safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Insurance has risen across the board for all Australians, but it's astronomical for those in disaster zones and high-risk areas. When I went doorknocking in flood impacted pockets just in my community in Warringah, I found some constituents' insurance had jumped by double-figure marks or been completely denied. These people fall into the 12 per cent of Australians who are facing insurance stress as their home insurance is as much as two months salary and is simply unaffordable or unavailable. Across Australia, those areas at the highest risk of underinsurance are too often low-socioeconomic areas, those that can least afford it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the Insurance Council of Australia released its annual catastrophe report, which showed that the last year of extreme weather events had collectively led to almost 157,000 claims and $2.2 billion in insured losses, highlighting the risk of underinsurance. Over the past five years, Australia has reached an average of $4.5 billion a year in losses, with floods being the main driver of this increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we urgently need to reduce and limit warming by mitigating emissions. You cannot acknowledge the scale of this problem and then do nothing for years on end. But we also must now protect communities, and especially small businesses, by being clear about the scale of the challenges that they face with accelerating climate risk. In my electorate of Warringah, there are flood impacted zones where some of my constituents have invested to make their homes more resilient, only to face—because this is not recognised by insurers—extortionate insurance costs, leading to underinsurance, or no insurance being available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, we have the Resilient Building Council joining the dots and using its Resilience Rating tool to provide insurers who have committed to the scheme, such as IAG and Suncorp, with the confidence and certification needed to in turn reduce insurance costs. Programs like this and the inclusion of adaptation in the sustainable finance taxonomy must be funded to help families make their homes resilient and unlock private capital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise, we need to ensure that the millions of new homes being built are built to withstand the new world they will be existing in. Communities need to be safe. They must be climate resilient and, in particular, heat resilient. There must be changes to the National Construction Code to include adaptation and minimum resilience standards for public housing, and we must accelerate national, state and territory coordination to ensure that no house is built in a high-risk disaster zone. Tomorrow I will hold a roundtable discussion with stakeholders, including economists like Guy Debelle, about what is needed to manage climate risks and the escalating costs. I call on the government to do more in this space.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  I thank the member for Warringah for bringing this motion to parliament, and I acknowledge her significant contribution to our national discourse about action on climate change. She knows, like all of us on the side of the House, that climate change isn't a distant threat. It's here, it's now, and it's reshaping our environment in ways that have profound implications for all of us. The extreme weather events that used to be rare are becoming more frequent and more severe, and they're driving up the cost of living in ways we can no longer ignore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These events don't just damage our homes and infrastructure; they are primary drivers of the skyrocketing insurance premiums that so many Australians are struggling to afford. We know that insurance premiums are a contributing factor to stubbornly high inflation across the world. It's no surprise, then, that we see the impact of high premiums in areas most acutely impacted by climate change. In these areas across the country, some residents have seen increases of over 80 per cent to their insurance prices. This is not just an economic burden; it's a threat to the very security of these communities' resilience and livability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fundamental issue here is clear: as the climate crisis intensifies, so too does the financial strain on all of us. According to the Climate Council, insurance premiums across Australia are on a steep incline, with many households now facing the grim reality of being underinsured or even uninsured. The very nature of insurance—being a pool to support every policyholder—means that this is a problem for all of us. The rising frequency of natural disasters means that more and more Australians are finding it difficult to afford insurance that they need to protect their homes and their businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The solution to this problem isn't simple, but it begins with acknowledging the root cause: climate change. Now, I say that with a caveat. It's simple for the government to understand that. It's simple for the member for Warringah and the crossbench to understand that. But this is something that the Liberals and the Nationals still do not understand. I'll spell it out for them: to address inflation and to address the cost of insurance, we must address climate change. Every dollar invested in resilience, whether it be through better infrastructure, improved building standards or community education, can save us up to $11 in disaster recovery. The Albanese government is aware of this challenge, and it has taken steps to address it, but we must acknowledge that these actions are part of a broader effort to combat the effects of climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2022 Australia witnessed one of the most devastating flood events in our recent history. The sheer scale of the destruction was matched only by the profound impact it had on those affected. As a member of the parliamentary inquiry into insurers' responses to these floods, I had the privilege of hearing directly from the people whose lives were turned upside down by this disaster. What became abundantly clear throughout this inquiry is that the insurance system as it currently stands is not fully equipped to deal with the increasing frequency and severity of climate related disasters. The findings and recommendations that will come from this inquiry are critical, not just for improving how insurers respond to future disasters but also for ensuring that Australians can have confidence that their policies will protect them when they need it most. This inquiry has reinforced the importance of government action in addressing the challenges posed by climate change and its impact on the insurance sector. One of the most significant steps we can take is integrating climate resilience into our national construction code and land use planning. In June 2024, Australian building ministers agreed to add climate resilience as an objective of the Australian Building Codes Board. This paved the way for them to consider future standards to incorporate climate resilience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important, though, to acknowledge that these measures alone are not enough and there's much more to do. The member for Warringah's calls for more action are reasonable and measured. Having worked in insurance and having listened to councils and policyholders, I know that we are heading towards a really terrible economic and ecological situation. Governments will need to work out what to do when insurers increasingly refuse to insure or price insurance out of consideration. Unlike the Liberals, who have their heads in the sand on climate change and action, the sensible people in this place must remain committed to the broader systemic changes that address the root causes of climate change and invest in climate resilience.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know extreme weather events are now the new normal. In fact, it was almost five years ago that the then head of the Australian Defence Force, General Angus Campbell, sought to warn us that Australia is in the most natural disaster prone region in the world and that climate change is predicted to make disasters more extreme and more common. Weather extremes are projected to worsen as the climate warms further. These include increasing temperatures, more frequent heat waves, more storm events, less rainfall in many places and increased storm surges in others. With worsening extreme weather comes rising costs, costs that currently full on ordinary Australians, including rising insurance premiums, declining property values and a large mental health toll. Not only are these costs borne by ordinary households and businesses but they are more likely to fall on regional and rural Australians and lower income households who are least able to afford them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community of North Sydney and indeed many Australians are acutely aware that severe weather events are already costing the Australian economy, and they believe it is untenable and unethical for these increasing costs to continue to be borne by those on the front line. They have long called for strong action to improve the resilience and adaptation of Australian communities, homes and infrastructure. It's for this reason that I wholeheartedly support the motion moved by the member for Warringah, a motion that calls on the government to implement sensible, practical and achievable measures to improve Australia's climate resilience, including by ensuring building codes are fit for purpose, incentivising home adaptation measures, unlocking global capital for private-sector-led resilience and ensuring equitable access to insurance. Failing to plan, invest and act now is tantamount to putting our fingers in our ears and ignoring the science that tells us climate impacts will worsen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course the first line of defence against climate impacts is reducing emissions. There's a long way to go on that front, but adaptation and resilience measures must be considered alongside strong mitigation plans and, to date, they've not been afforded the focus they deserve. We must start making climate informed decisions when it comes to the investment, location, insurance and design of our buildings. That means funding the organisations with a proven track record of helping to increase resilience of the built environment. This includes the Resilient Building Council, which operates on the principle that everyone has the right to safe, healthy, secure housing, and whose mission it is to realise that, right through a resilience revolution, better housing for all contributes to a thriving, sustainable community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It means ensuring our building codes are fit for purpose because decisions made about homes today will continue to have consequences for many decades. The average life of a brick home in this country at the moment is 88 years, while a timber home will last 58 years. Many homes last much longer than this, and public buildings, particularly, are asked to stand well into the next century. To futureproof these homes and buildings we need a robust national standard for adaptation decision-making that considers climate risk as part of our land use planning and building reform processes, as previously proposed by the National Cabinet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, climate resilience and adaptation must be included as a matter of priority in the upcoming update to the National Construction Code. Organisations across the world are currently updating standards or writing new ones that take future climate into consideration, and it's time Australia followed suit. Smart governance in a changing climate also means putting adaptations squarely within the remit of the sustainable finance taxonomy to enable cross-border flows of sustainable finance and accelerate the flow of capital into investments that not only support Australia's transition to net zero but also unlock private sector led resilience and adaptation measures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, we must ensure equitable access to insurance, financial services and support, so lower-income households and regional Australians in high-risk areas are not left behind. As we've heard, the adaptation measures we take today pay dividends in the future. Every dollar spent on adaptation measures now returns an order of magnitude more in the years ahead and in direct and indirect benefits. Just last week experts from government, financial services, property and community gathered at the National Industry Roundtable on Land Use Planning and Resilience to say the time is now for action on land use planning and reforms. The informed measures proposed by the member for Warringah would help avoid the impacts of disasters when they occur. I commend the motion to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this matter, because rising insurance costs across all sectors of insurance are directly contributing to cost-of-living pressures, inflation and household financial stress. For years climate scientists have been warning that extreme weather events are going to become more frequent and more severe. The warnings have become reality. Across the world, fires, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and drought are constantly with us, including here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wherever they occur throughout the world also affects us because most of the insurers insure with global insurance companies who spread their risks right across the world. Every year now our nation seems to react to one or more natural disasters that cause extensive destruction and loss of lives, property and infrastructure. Such destruction increases insurance claims, as other speakers have already said, and ultimately results in higher insurance premiums.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the increased risks associated with extreme weather events which have been forecast directly increase the cost of insurance. If the risk is greater, the insurance premium is greater. Increased risks also lead to more people dropping out of insurance cover at a time when, in fact, it is needed the most. I understand that right now, based on the latest figures, somewhere between 15 and 25 per cent of Australian households have no insurance at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has also been notable is that the insurance costs have lifted to a point where they are simply unaffordable for so many families. In fact, according to one report, between 2020 and 2023, Allianz, one of our biggest insurers, increased their costs by some 56 per cent. Adding to the extreme weather issues, the current high construction costs and high repair costs, once the damage occurs, become another additional cost that has to be borne by the homeowner and by the insurance company on top of those costs. And, again, we see an increase in insurance premiums.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The insurance issue is being talked about each and every day in the community, and I'm pleased to see that it is also the subject of a parliamentary inquiry led by the member for Fraser. I look forward to the findings of that report. I believe the member for Bennelong mentioned it as a sitting member of that committee as well. Their contribution will certainly help guide us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are measures that can be taken—and, again, other members have spoken about this—to minimise the risk. Changing and strengthening the building code and the planning regulations, undergrounding powerlines, implementing flood levies and improving disaster preparedness to minimise destruction are things we can do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to point to one example in my own community. Only earlier this year, in a community led initiative following the devastating 2015 Sampson Flat bushfires, Jan Verrall and Denise Elland spearheaded a drive to establish a water tank in their region in the Upper Hermitage area so that when a future fire occurs, unlike in the last case, the CFS trucks are able to access water to put out those fires. It was a community led initiative. It was opened only a couple of months ago, and I commend that local committee for doing so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said all that, I also believe that the insurance companies are profiteering. Across all insurance sectors, over the last four financial years, the insurance sector, according to one report, made $7.3 billion in profit. So, whilst the home insurance areas might be struggling, across all sectors they made $7.3 billion in profit. I suspect they've done that because they push up their premiums on the argument that everything is going up, when the truth of the matter is that they should also spread their risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is responding. As has been said, we have the Hazards Insurance Partnership, where the government and the insurance sector are sharing data. There is a $4 billion disaster resilience, recovery and readiness funding in place. National planning and building codes are being discussed right now across the country. The insurance readiness and self-assessment rating scheme, which also helps lower insurance, is currently underway. This is an issue that requires the collaboration of all three levels of government, the insurance sector and the broader community. I believe that the message is out there loud and clear, and that is happening right now.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mrs PHILLIPS:</span>
                  </a>  I'm really pleased to move this private member's motion today, because the wonderful, dedicated individuals that nurture our youngest citizens are some of the most vital workers in our country. Every day, parents trust early educators with the most important thing in their world: their children. Every day, Australia asks early educators to do one of the most important jobs imaginable. They deserve our thanks, and they deserve to be paid properly. That's why I wholeheartedly welcome this government's decision to fund a 15 per cent pay rise for early childhood education and care workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Early educators are helping shape the youngest generation in my electorate of Gilmore. As a mum of four, I've seen firsthand over many years the significant work local early learning centres do to nurture and create better, smarter and more capable Australians. As it happens, when the 15 per cent pay rise was announced by this government on 9 August during Early Learning Matters Week, I was visiting ECTARC The Basin Early Education and Care Service, which provides care for children from two to school age at Sanctuary Point. I sat down with the educators and the children and could feel the love, passion and special connection the educators have with the youngsters in their care. It was very easy to see the wide variety of educational and fun activities that the children were working on, which they got me to help them with. I particularly liked the large soft dice that one of the children threw, and then we posed similarly to what it landed on. Yes, we both did the warrior pose and more. I loved sitting in a circle with the children and educators and, together, we sang. There was art, groovy coloured sand and outdoor activities. These amazing educators deserve recognition for the hard work and commitment they put in every day. But they deserve much more than recognition; they deserve to be paid fairly. The staff at ECTARC The Basin Education and Care Service were thrilled when I shared the good news for workers, families and children during my visit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In regional areas like Gilmore, attracting workers into the early education sector can be tough, and young staff often leave the industry because of low pay. This government is looking after them. We are getting wages moving, which will attract and retain our early childhood education workforce. For a typical worker, the 15 per cent pay rise will mean they will receive at least $103 more in their pay packet each week from December 2024, increasing to at least $155 per week from December 2025.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are investing in our early learning educators, it is important to reiterate that the Albanese government is also keeping costs down and easing cost-of-living pressures for families by limiting fee increases at childcare centres. Childcare centres will not be permitted to increase their fees by more than 4.4 per cent over the next 12 months, which means, while wages are increasing for workers, downward pressure will be placed on fees for families. That's a massive win-win.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a $3.6 billion investment. This is a two-year commitment while the Fair Work Commission looks at the work value case which is taking place. The Productivity Commission inquiry has shown that, unless we do something about wages in this sector, we won't have a workforce. You shouldn't earn more stacking supermarket shelves than you do looking after our youngest Australians in such fantastic way. So this is a really important commitment that we are making.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This significant wage increase is a wonderful outcome for a highly feminised work force that has for far too long been neglected and taken for granted. Early childhood educators shape lives and change lives. We can never thank them enough for what they do, but we can make sure they are properly valued and fairly paid. Our government is doing just that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  I reckon they would be listening with interest in Gerringong, Nowra, Shellharbour, Ulladulla and Warilla at the moment to the member's contribution, putting forward this motion about childhood education and care educators. Yes, we want the best for those people who work in that sector. But two words that the member for Gilmore, a regional member, did not mention are 'accessibility' and 'availability'. One of the greatest concerns for parents and families in country areas is actually being able to have an early childhood learning centre and have that care provided in a regional setting. It's simply not good enough just to talk about wage rises for early childhood educators and mention all of those things without mentioning accessibility and availability. I know in my Riverina electorate we have a being void created by a childhood centre closing in Lockhart at the moment. I know even in Wagga Wagga it's difficult to get places for families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a great conversation with Nicole Wishart recently. She is the director and nominated supervisor at Inspire Early Learning Centre on Kooringal Road. She wrote a lengthy letter to me and she said, 'When families are unenrolled, they suffer additional financial burdens due to increased costs associated with finding alternative care arrangements. This strain not only affects their financial stability but also impacts their ability to work and contribute to the economy. Furthermore, the lack of support services exacerbates workforce issues, creating a cycle of inefficiency and economic hardship.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I know Labor is out there addressing the wages and I am sure the member for Moncrieff will have more to say, because she understands very much our position and the position adopted by families right across this nation. What we are seeing, particularly in this area, is a lack of accessibility and availability. You very much don't hear that from those opposite, because they don't get the fact that there is a problem in those areas. If the member for Gilmore were to listen to her constituents, I am sure that's what they would say to her. It's accessibility and availability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, our childhood educators should be paid a fair day's work for a fair day's wage. There is no question about that. But it's about accessibility and availability in regional areas, which is the great concern. And why should our country families be disadvantaged? Why isn't the government doing more to help our regional families? It is because they don't care. In so many policy areas right across the board, we see every day of every week the fact that regional pleas and cries for services and amenities are just ignored. It's down to centres and placements. It's about Labor's lack of care for regional areas, and it's such a shame because families in regional centres are important too. During COVID and at any other given time, it is regional areas are leading the way through mining, through agriculture—</span>

It is being expressed across the board, and the government is doing very little, if anything, about it. It's about accessibility and it's about availability. Those two areas are being ignored. This motion put forward by a regional member, no less than the member for Gilmore, doesn't address this issue, and it should because it is a great concern. I'm sure it's a great concern for the members on the south coast because it is right across the board. I urge and encourage those members to get out there and listen to the mums and dads, particularly in regional areas, because this is of grave concern.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="264170" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  I want to thank the very hardworking member for Gilmore for bringing forward this private member's motion talking about one of the most important things for any society. There are a few facts that we need to establish. I know you, Deputy Speaker Freelander, as a lifelong doctor, someone who has worked helping children as a paediatrician, someone who has had his own fair swag of kids—six, if I'm not mistaken—have made your contribution to our population! I thank you for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that people listening to this are hearing about early education and caring for children. Whether or not you've had children of your own, there is a principle: being a parent is both the best job and the hardest job in the world. It's not unlike being a politician, to be frank. It brings with it great joys but also great challenges. I do get somewhat concerned when people are averse to talking about the care of children alongside their education, because for me it is not just about educating young children; it is about their care as well because in that care comes a world of education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my seat of Paterson, I am blessed with some of the best early childhood educators and carers that money can buy, and let's face it: this is also about money. When you pay people well, you get a really good outcome. When you value the work that people do, you get a really good outcome. That is the message that this Albanese government is sending not only to early childhood carers and educators but to parents across Australia. We value the care and education of your children and we are prepared to pay for it. As a society I think most people would agree with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate I recently had a brilliant Saturday afternoon at a local park in Thornton called Wirraway Park when did a mobile office session there. The park was packed with parents and their small children, who were playing on equipment, with balls and going down slippery slides. It was wonderful. While I was there, two women visited me at my mobile office and I had the most incredible experience with them because they came to talk to me about their sector, which was early childhood care and education, and they were talking about the pay rise they were seeking. In the time they were speaking to me, no less than half a dozen children in that park came up to those two women and knew them, and it was just brilliant. The interaction they had with the children was such a powerful thing for me to witness. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank those two women—Christine Scott and her daughter Hannah—who work at the Community Kids Thornton Child Care and Early Education Centre for not only what they do every day going to work but for the light that they'd created in the lives of those young people who interacted with them and me at Wirraway Park that day. Christine and Hannah talked to me about the challenges and their lived experience in their industry. This is a female dominated sector, and despite the important role of child educators and carers in our society it is still a low-paying job. That can't continue, and as a government we've recognised that. For women around the country this is a real problem and that's why we're trying to deliver the best solution we can deliver at this point in time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our reforms to early childhood education are about recognising and growing this industry. We want more young people—whether they're women or young men—to be involved in early childhood education. It is vital. We are supporting centres to retain their staff and we're continuing to develop and strengthen recruitment and training pathways, which is so important. Our fee-free TAFE program has delivered a boost to the industry, with a Cert III in early childhood education and care being the most popular in the country. That speaks volumes about this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know a lot of people will say, 'But last time you did something with childcare costs they were just absorbed by the centres themselves.' We've now recognised that that can't happen again. As part of this agreement, we have said that the centres that are going to receive this uptick in funding can't put up their prices. That is so important as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I want to say that we are doing absolutely everything that we can to not only attract people to this sector, but retain them by paying them well. We're going to continue to educate them well and we are going to continue to seek to improve the productivity of our country by getting more people to work because their children are in excellent education facilities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="282981" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  For the last 2½ years I've had the great honour to serve as the shadow minister for early childhood education. During that time, I've spent a lot of time travelling the country, speaking with educators, with children and with parents, oftentimes with children sitting on their knees when we meet. I've visited numerous early learning services and preschools. I've also visited many communities that have no services at all. It's about accessibility and affordability, as the good member for Riverina pointed out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These communities are using whatever means possible to get care for their children, and in many cases that's informal care, so they can return to work and pay their bills. Unfortunately, this problem is only getting worse, so it is a bit rich of those opposite to continue to talk about their cheaper childcare policy and their plans for universal early learning when there are families all over our great country languishing without support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many children are starting school developmentally behind their peers because the government has conveniently forgotten about communities living in regional, rural and remote areas. The Albanese government invested $4.7 billion into childcare subsidies, most of which was eaten away by inflation—it just went up in smoke. It failed to deliver one single place for a child anywhere in regional Australia. That is the problem with Labor. They want to win votes. They don't care about delivering good policy, and that's something we've seen time and time again from this Albanese Labor government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week they announced a $3.6 billion wage subsidy for early childhood educators. Early childhood educators, carers and teachers do incredible work for our community—there's no doubt about that—and those on this side of the chamber also want to see them have better pay. But that isn't the issue. The issue is that real wages have declined by nine per cent and living standards have collapsed by eight per cent all because this Labor government can't stop spending. What that means for educators is that, come December, they'll find little extra money in their pockets because inflation is spiralling and they'll end up having to spend that extra money on all of those bills that are mounting and that just continue to go up and up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With this announcement, of course, the devil is in the detail. Labor stood up at an early learning service and said a lot of nice things, but they didn't provide any real details. As the days pass, it becomes clear why they aren't giving answers: this Labor government didn't think any further than a nice, shiny headline. They're creating policy on the run, announcing funding and then saying, 'Don't worry about the details.' We've heard that many times from this Prime Minister and his ministers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest farce with this policy is that Labor think they can inject $3.6 billion into the sector and keep fees down using a cap. I know it's hard for those opposite to understand because none of them have ever run a business, let alone an economy, but, when your costs are higher than your income, you have to cut costs somewhere, and that's exactly what we're likely to see under this policy, because many of these providers continue to watch their electricity, gas and grocery bills soar, in part thanks to the economic mismanagement of this Labor government. In fact, there's a real chance that services already paying staff 10 or 15 per cent above the award wage won't sign onto this. They'll pay their staff a little bit more and then they'll just increase their prices anyway, and that will land in families' laps. Even if some services keep fees down this year and next year, families will still be hit with eye-watering bills when the government funding dries up because providers will then be forced to pick up the wages tab and to do that they will have to increase their fees. Families understand that, but the government doesn't seem to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sector tells me a 10 per cent wage increase usually means a seven per cent fee increase. But that's of course a post-election problem for this government, something that this Labor government doesn't want you to think about as we head to the polls in the next eight months. If they cared about the sector like they claim to, they could have announced this in their first budget. They could have kept their policy from the 2019 federal election, but they dumped it after they dumped that opposition leader too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To make matters worse, we've been hearing about another dodgy union peddling lies amongst educators. Yes, the CFMEU isn't the only dodgy union. A union heavily involved in the early learning sector is back to its old tricks, telling educators they'll only get this pay rise if they are a member of the union. It's completely untrue, it's misleading and it's despicable behaviour from a union heavily associated with those opposite. I call on the Prime Minister to call them out.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:28</span>):  I rise to support the motion moved by the good member for Gilmore. There are no two ways about it: early childhood education is one of the nation's most vitally important professions. It is so important that the educators and staff in the sector are paid appropriately for the crucial role that they play in the Australian story. Without these educators, without the hundreds and hundreds of hours that these workers put into the lives of our nation's future at the most important time of a child's development, Australia would be far, far worse off. It is an unimaginable scenario for our country to go without the efforts of workers in early childhood education, and that's why, for this Labor government, it's a priority to ensure that the sector can operate sustainably to benefit children, families and workers alike.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why these increases to the income of early childhood educators are so important. They saw a 4.6 per cent rise in 2022, a 5.75 per cent rise in 2023 and a 3.75 per cent rise in 2024. Now they are seeing a historic 15 per cent rise announced two weeks ago. These raises are changing lives, not just for the workers who are deservedly receiving them, who can now 'buy actual, proper groceries and not sausages and bread' to quote Bec, who is an early educator working just up the road from me in Hillbank, but for the children they educate every single day and for the families that these workers support through years of their lives. This is capping fee increases by providers to make sure that costs are not being passed on to families. This is helping early learning centres across the country retain their current staff, at a time when retention has been extremely difficult. And this is ensuring that these places of learning and growth are sustainable and continue helping children across the country to thrive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The increase in income for educators and staff also makes it easier for the sector to attract new workers, to add to their capacity, to build on the more than 30,000 workers who have entered the sector since Labor came into government and to strengthen the backbone of early childhood development in this country, lightening the heavy load that has already been set upon educators in Australia. The 15 per cent pay increase that was announced a couple of weeks ago is not just a deserved one for early childhood workers, finally reflecting their important roles for families and children; it is also a needed one, to make sure the early childhood education sector can continue to guide our children in the most transformative stages of an Australian's life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't just take it from me. Far more important are the voices of educators themselves. So I'd like to share the thoughts of workers in my electorate of Spence, coming into work at the Hillbank Community Children's Centre over and over again, and what these changes mean for workers in the sector. Janaya, Amanda, Bec, Misty, Kristina, Connie, Sarah and Courtney are just eight individuals who have been waiting for this pay rise. To them, this is recognition that their work is valued by Australia, for the monumental impact it has both now and for generations to come. As Connie put it, 'This pay rise means that I and every other educator feel valued and recognised for the work we do.' It's also vindication: receiving pay that finally reflects the effort that goes into their work, both in and outside of the centre. So often, these roles are not just nine-to-fives; there's also demanding preparation, before and after work hours. It's also about maintaining contact with families who are in vulnerable situations, to ensure that they and their children have adequate support. So, it's absolutely necessary to reflect the extra mile educators tend to go. As Kristina put it: 'This will help staff because they can afford to make ends meet. Many educators are working parents, so earning more means I can put my child into care and work better hours.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, to the Hillbank Community Children's Centre and all the workers in early childhood education and care in Spence and beyond: thank you. Your work is invaluable. And the story does not end there, because this is a Labor government that is continuing to work with educators across the sector, to guide policy that works for them, as well as the parents and children of our nation. That's because having better-off workers in early childhood education means having better education for our children and a better future for our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I'll just make a comment in relation to the words of the member for Riverina. We need to attract more educators to this sector. This pay rise goes to the exact heart of that. That is how we find a solution when it comes to a lack of educators and places in those childcare facilities. Thank you.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:33</span>):  It must be Monday in parliament: we've got the out-of-touch government patting themselves on the back, telling the Australian people how lucky they are and that they've never had it better, whether it's energy prices, whether it's cost of living and now child care—never had it better. Well, let's touch on that discussion around regional and rural areas. My community has a childcare desert, like the electorate of the member for Riverina.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What those opposite don't want to talk about is the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's childcare inquiry. They'll talk about the supposed drop in prices, which I'll get to, but none of them seem to have read the inquiry, because, when it comes to regional and rural areas and availability, the inquiry said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Policy measures that continue to apply a 'one size fits all approach' across the sector will leave some communities under-served, unserved or without adequate and appropriate access to childcare services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's exactly what the member for Riverina was talking about, it's exactly what I'm talking about and it's what many in regional and rural Australia talk about: getting access, which is through supply. And as the inquiry said—which the government are happy to quote—a one-size-fits-all approach does not work. But it's not a surprise that this government forgets about regional, rural and periurban Australia. The Prime Minister went to that tough childcare desert of inner Marrickville—inner Sydney—to announce this policy, so we know that this policy is not going to help supply in communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my community, there are 15 children for every spot. There are 15 kids and there's one spot. There are families that are putting themselves on wait lists at their 12-week scan. I thank Belinda and the team at Mums of the Hills for their continued advocacy and the work they've done. They shared that story with me and the shadow minister and many others. There are parents that are having to pay fees just to get onto wait lists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And let's move to fees, because this motion is very much in the government's playbook of spinning and talking a big game. They quote the ACCC childcare inquiry, which found that out-of-pocket costs dropped 11 per cent following the introduction of the government's cheaper childcare measures. What they didn't quote and what they won't talk about is what else the inquiry said. It said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our inquiry finds that historically when subsidies increase, out-of-pocket expenses decline initially but then tend to revert to higher levels … Further to this, our inquiry finds that that the design and implementation of the Child Care Subsidy … has had only limited effectiveness in placing downward pressure on fees and constraining the burden on taxpayers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry was in December 2023 and the government were very happy to quote it in August of 2024 in this motion, but what they didn't put in the motion is that childcare costs have increased by 8.4 per cent in the last six months—just like the inquiry said it would. This is why we've got a government that are all about spin and patting themselves on the back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They also talk about the rent caps at 4.4 per cent. Let's ignore the fact that 4.4 per cent is well above the RBA's two-to-three-per-cent target, and talk about the hypocrisy of this Prime Minister and his inability to understand basic economics. This Prime Minister stands at the despatch box in question time when he gets a question from his friends in the Greens about rent caps and talks about how he can't implement rent caps because that's going to constrain investment in housing. But at the very same time, this government are prepared to put caps on gas prices, and they're now prepared to put caps on childcare places. So apparently a cap on housing and rents will constrain supply but a cap on gas and a cap on childcare prices won't constrain supply.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be clear, I don't think we should have any price caps—we should actually be focused on driving costs down and treating the cause of inflation, like increased energy prices that have continued to go up under this government, not bandaid solutions. But for the Prime Minister to argue that caps won't work for rents but they will work for gas and they will work for childcare tells you he will say anything to anyone to stay in his job, or that he does not understand the basics of economics. The reality is, it's both.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  The first five years of a child's life are pivotal not only for their education but also for their overall development. These early years shape who they will become, influencing everything from their academic success to their ability to contribute to society. Increasingly, our youngest are being taught in early childhood education centres across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work these early educators do is vital for our children and for our economy, and for decades these workers have been underpaid. We've changed that, and it took a Labor government to do it. In my time as the member for Bennelong I've had the privilege of meeting countless dedicated ECEC educators—one in particular, called Claire. Claire told me that she and her fellow educators love their jobs, but they often find themselves having to choose between their profession and basic necessities like putting food on the table or paying rent in a really tough housing market. This is not a choice anyone should have to make, especially not those who are entrusted with the education and care of our children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government understands the transformative power of early childhood education, not just for our children but for our families, our communities and our economy. That's why we've taken real, concrete steps towards our goal of accessible, affordable and universal early childhood education. Firstly, we've implemented the $5 billion boost to the sector through our cheaper childcare reforms. These reforms are already making a difference, delivering genuine cost-of-living relief to over 1.2 million families across the country. We've seen out-of-pocket costs for centre based day care drop by 11 per cent, and it's also removed penalties on those who want to work an extra day or two.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But making child care and early education more affordable is only one part of the solution. We also needed to address the workforce shortage and retention issues that the sector has been facing for so long. Early childhood educators need more than thanks; they need better pay. That's why our government's announcement of a two-year 15 per cent ECEC worker retention payment, starting in December 2024, is so significant. This isn't just about boosting take-home pay; it's about retaining and attracting the dedicated educators we need to sustain and grow our ECEC sector. For too long, early childhood educators have been overworked and underpaid. We've heard stories of educators relying on food banks to feed their families or working two or three jobs just to make ends meet. That is simply unacceptable. These workers are helping to shape the next generation of Australians, and they deserve better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The wage increase delivered by Labor will mean that a typical educator will receive an extra $103 per week, increasing to at least $155 per week from December 2025. For our early childhood teachers, that increase will be even more substantial: an additional $166 a week, going up to $249 a week in the same time. To ensure that this wage increase doesn't lead to unaffordable fee hikes for families, we've introduced important safeguards. Early learning services that want to access this funding will need to commit to limiting their fee increases to no more than 4.4 per cent, a measure which will keep downward pressure on fees and ensure that the benefits of our reforms are felt by both families and educators alike.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're doing all of this because we have a vision for this sector. We think that early childhood education is good for families and good for the economy. This should not be contested. But, in the alternative reality that exists amongst the Liberals and Nationals, it is. You see, while we're investing in early childhood education, the Liberals are attacking it. Liberal Senator Gerard Rennick said only last week that our early educators infect our children with the 'woke mind virus' and that early education destroys the family unit. These views are horrible and may have had carriage in 1824, but we are in 2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Liberals attack workers and families who use early childhood education, we want to ensure that every family can access it. We want universal early childhood education, in the true Labor tradition of fairness and equality. Early childhood education is good for workers, it's good for families and it's good for our economy. It's good to help address the gender pay gap and increase workforce participation, and we'll support it every day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the lack of sleep was worth it, wasn't it, to watch our athletes in Paris achieve our highest Olympic medal tally ever? It is a real credit to the efforts of every single one of them, but we should recognise that no-one gets there on their own. From the parents to the coaches to the sporting clubs, so much has got to go right for an athlete to reach the top level, and a big part of that is ensuring access to the right facilities, which was the promise of Labor's Play Our Way program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remember the context of Labor's policy announcement. During the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, our Matildas were remarkable, and there was a real belief that they could go all the way. The Prime Minister then promised a one-off public holiday if they won the tournament. This was a populist stunt, of course, that would have cost the economy some $2 billion and would have adversely impacted small businesses when they could least afford it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we believed in an alternative approach that would build on the legacy of our female sporting heroes in a positive and transformative way. So we announced our commitment to deliver $250 million towards ensuring that women and young girls playing grassroots sport have access to appropriate and improved facilities. We also announced we would seek state and territory funding to match our investment, generating a total investment of $500 million. Just days after our announcement, Labor announced a program of their own. While this was, as this motion describes, a backfoot response to our announcement, I still welcomed it. I welcomed this investment because there is a real need to improve sporting infrastructure across Australia, especially regional Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, here we are, 12 months after Labor's announcements, with nothing to show for it. Community sporting organisations have been left in limbo, with clubs that are still unaware of whether they've been successful. This, of course, grinds those sporting organisations' plans to upgrade to a halt. This delay makes clear that this was simply more policy on the run by this government and that those opposite, once again, care more about the announcement than the delivery. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At last week's Parliamentary Friends of The AFL event, it was great to hear we now have the first generation of girls who have a direct pathway from Auskick all the way to a professional national competition. However, as the Leader of the Opposition said at that event, much of the sporting infrastructure that exists is not inclusive of girls. In many places, girls are still expected to use the same change rooms as boys or, in some cases, there is simply no capacity to expand game time to include girls. That is simply not good enough in 2024. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been very pleased to advocate on behalf of clubs in my own electorate of Durack and to have previously secured grant funding. For example, in 2019 I was pleased to deliver a $150,000 grant towards upgrades ensuring that women in the Great Northern Football League had access to their own change facilities, but there is more to be done. The Kalannie Hockey Club have written to me about their need for new portable goals on wheels. They play on dirt pitches, and they require the might of the men's footy team to help them move the current set. Just a small investment would be sufficient in enabling the club to source these goals. The West Kimberley Junior Football League has also told me they have reached maximum capacity, with no ability to establish more teams. They also need to improve their storage facilities, with equipment for their 26 teams currently being stored in multiple people's homes. More recently, I enjoyed catching up with the hardworking Cath Widdup. She's the president of the Port Hedland Netball Association, and we discussed the desperate need for a roof over their netball courts. It's the Pilbara. It's hot. This infrastructure is a must. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me conclude by talking about the power of sport. As a former basketballer, a former netballer and a 21-year member of the Fremantle Football Club, I can testify that sport brings people together. Participating in sport is so important for the mental and physical health of our young people. Only today we saw more reporting about the number of hours children are spending on social media. I think we'd all agree it would be much better for our children if they spent more time outside on the sporting field than on their devices. So I call on the government: stop the delay, step up and support our sporting clubs. More than ever, our regional Australian sporting clubs need you. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  Sport is the heartbeat of our communities. From early morning soccer matches at the local park to netball games under the evening lights, sport brings us together, fosters a sense of belonging and instils values beyond the field. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Bennelong, I've seen firsthand how sports transform lives. I've watched local clubs grow from humble beginnings into vibrant community hubs that offer so much more than just a place to play. I worked alongside Bennelong sporting clubs for over a decade in my capacity as a mayor and a councillor before coming to this place, and I know that sports fields are a place of learning, support and opportunity. In Australia, they are essential to the social fabric of our communities. But, for sport to continue to play this vital role, we must ensure it is accessible to everyone. The Play Our Way program is not, as the opposition suggests, a reactionary measure. It's a cornerstone of our government's commitment to inclusivity, designed to address longstanding inequities in sports participation, particularly for women and girls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past decade, women's participation in sports has boomed, and local councils and their sportsgrounds have struggled to deal with the demand. The Play Our Way program is designed to address these longstanding issues. It's designed to help girls and women have fair and equal access to the same sporting opportunities as boys and men. These funds will help address shortfalls with upgrades to sporting facilities, building unisex change rooms and increasing lighting around sporting grounds so that women and girls are safe at night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking at this motion by the member for Durack, I have to say it's a bit of an own goal—pardon the pun—because it gives me the opportunity to compare and contrast the record of this government with that of the last government. This government will not take lectures from those opposite about funding sporting facilities. The Liberals and Nationals are the lot who brought a sports rort scandal, where public funds were used to benefit Liberal Party marginal seats. They are the ones who handed out grants based on colour-coded spreadsheets, not on clubs' or communities' actual needs. They are the lot who funded facilities for women's sports clubs when they didn't even have women's teams in the club. It wasn't just an ethical failure; it was an absolute scandal. Over 400 legitimate, highly rated applications for their sports rorts program were ignored in favour of projects chosen for their potential to secure votes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, our government is committed to integrity and fairness in sports funding. The Play Our Way program is set up so that all applications are assessed independently and thoroughly. They will be needs based and, believe it or not, will be delivered to clubs and organisations that actually apply for the funding. We will not take advice from the Liberals and Nationals on this issue. We've engaged with experts across sport and government, including through the establishment of an independent and expert advisory panel, to ensure that this program delivers the best possible outcome for women and girls in communities across Australia. This process is rigorous and meticulous. We've received over 600 applications from every corner of the country, each one representing a unique community with specific needs. To rush this process would be a disservice to those communities and would undermine the very purpose of this program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Bennelong, I have seen firsthand the excitement and anticipation that this program has generated. Local clubs that have long struggled with inadequate facilities are eager for the support that Play Our Way will provide. These are clubs where girls are still changing in men's bathrooms and playing on substandard fields. I've worked closely with many of these clubs over the years, advocating for their needs and supporting their growth. I know how desperately they need this funding not just to improve their facilities but to create an environment where women and girls feel welcome and encouraged to participate in sports. The Play Our Way program is designed to do just that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government wants to support projects that have a long-term impact by fostering a culture of inclusivity, and we will do that by ensuring that every dollar is spent openly and transparently and that each application has gone through an independent and thorough process.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281513" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  Play Our Way—well, the girls of today aren't going to be able to play anything, because things have been so delayed by this government. It is quite extraordinary. When I go out to local sporting clubs across my electorate, one of the things that they say to me is that they really miss those grants that the coalition had put in place to support grassroots sport and grassroots activity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this is really important from a very young age. I just came off the parliamentary inquiry into diabetes, and one of the big outcomes was that there is not enough investment in sport and activity for our young people. The communities that are most impacted are those that have socioeconomic disadvantage. It's really disappointing that, after the government made this announcement, 12 months ago, there are local sporting clubs out there just dying for upgrades but nothing is being done. Meanwhile, our kids are not getting the support that they need to be active, to be healthy, to be out there and participating in sport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We look at young girls in particular. This is the best time for them to be able to do that. We have so much inspiration from our sporting stars, from the Matildas to Jess and Noemie Fox, who are constituents in my electorate of Lindsay. These are great sporting champions. You've got the elite part of sport, and that trickles down to grassroots sport. Now is the time that we should have that investment in our local sporting clubs while young girls are looking to these Olympic champions and these are sporting champions across every single sporting code. But what are they getting? They're once again getting a government that promises the world and delivers very little.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community organisations are run by volunteers. These are volunteers that invest so much time, so much energy and so much passion into development of kids in sport and to our local community sports organisations. For them to put grants together is no easy feat. They are volunteers that work, they are parents and they don't have specific grants expertise—that's for sure—so it's a big deal for a local organisation to put a grant together, and they feel like they've been let down, because nothing is happening. They've put their time in, so why isn't the government returning that same effort and at least letting them know how they're going with the application process? We know that this announcement by the government was a back-foot response to our $250 million of investment into sporting infrastructure across the country, which was actually making a difference to local sporting groups. It was making a difference, with kids being healthier and more active and was particularly making a difference to girls in sport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like all of us, I have been to lots of local sporting clubs and lots of local sporting grounds, gone to those bathrooms and seen what a disgraceful situation it is for young girls to have to get changed in dirty old change rooms with the boys. Our investment in that was really key, and we need more investment like that. Our local sporting clubs really should not be at the other end of policymaking on the run when we have a government here that is more interested in photo opportunities. I've seen it myself in my local community: they don't invite the local member to participate in activities in their own community. They come in, they take the photo and they leave again. Unfortunately for our local sports clubs right now and particularly those that have an interest in investing in young girls in sport, they're being left with absolutely nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the back end of the Olympic Games, now is the time for the Albanese Labor government to be taking more of an interest in the future of sport in our country and in the future of girls' sport in particular. Let these clubs know exactly where they stand.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I'll refer to what the ASIO director-general himself has said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's a direct quote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">It's a direct quote from <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders </span>on 11 August.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These statements infer that Mr Mike Burgess AM, the director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, said that all people who had been issued a visa had been referred to ASIO. However, the direct quote from Mike Burgess from<span style="font-style:italic;"> Insiders</span> on 11 August was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If they've been issued a visa, they've gone through the process. Part of that visa process is, where criteria are hit, they're referred to my organisation and ASIO does its thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As is clear from this full reporting of the quote from Mr Burgess, the Prime Minister omitted key words when he purported to use a direct quote from Mr Burgess in question time on Thursday 15 August. He omitted the following words: 'part of that visa process is where criteria are hit'. I submit that, in omitting these words, the Prime Minister has changed the meaning of Mr Burgess's statement. It's reasonable to conclude that a person following proceedings—for example, via the House's official broadcast—may come to the conclusion, because of the Prime Minister's purported direct quote, that Mr Burgess said only what the Prime Minister told this House Mr Burgess said, but in fact Mr Burgess said something quite different.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I submit, on the basis of the matters I've raised, that the Prime Minister has deliberately misled the House such as would constitute a contempt of the House. I further make the point that I'm raising this matter with you at the earliest opportunity. There was no opportunity to do so after question time because, under the standing orders, the House was to proceed automatically to consider the matter of public importance, and there was no government business between the matter of public importance and the adjournment.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, another important factor here is that, when the Leader of the Opposition moved a motion seeking to suspend standing orders during the course of question time, he was relying on the Department of Parliamentary Services live captions of <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span><span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>It's appropriate, in bringing this matter to your attention, that we are able to rely on the proof copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. Of course, the complete House of Representatives <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> proof was published at 7.57 pm on Thursday evening. I note that, when the Leader of the Opposition raised this matter in question time last Thursday, you said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Just for clarity, it places the Speaker in a difficult position when I don't have an exact copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>in front of me at the time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was a perfectly reasonable proposition from you, Mr Speaker. I am therefore raising this matter at the first opportunity subsequent to the proof copy being available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the basis of these facts, Mr Speaker, I submit that I have raised this matter of privilege with you at the earliest opportunity in accordance with the standing orders, and I ask that you give your consideration to this matter.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear to every Australian that the Prime Minister has misled this parliament and has misled the Australian public. He didn't have the ability, the determination or the strength to come in here last week and answer these serious claims, and he's missing in action again today. This parliament has now sat for two hours today, and the Prime Minister should have come in here at the ringing of the bells to correct the record—to explain to the Australian public and to this parliament why he misled them in that fashion last week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's one thing to come into this parliament and to quote from a document. The Prime Minister is perfectly entitled to do that, as is any member. You might leave out a sentence for the purposes of brevity or to make a point, but you can't leave out the middle of one sentence that you're quoting and pretend that that is an accurate reflection of what has been said by the person you are quoting. It's beyond tricky; it's duplicitous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister walks both sides of the street. The Australian public know that. The Australian public clearly are disappointed in this Prime Minister. We get that. He's made wrong decisions in relation to the renewables-only policy, which has driven up the price of energy and now the prospect of blackouts. We have a Prime Minister who has presided over different policies, including in housing and migration, that have made it harder for Australians to buy homes. We have young Australians who have lost the dream of homeownership because of the government's policy to bring in a million people over two years when they only build a quarter of a million homes. We have a Prime Minister who is walking both sides of the street, telling the Jewish community one thing and the Muslim community something completely different. He's telling the Indigenous community one thing in relation to the makarrata commission, which he has purposefully redesigned now to mean something else, even though there's money in the budget for a makarrata commission. So he's telling the Indigenous population one thing and the non-Indigenous population something other than what he's telling the first group. He walks into one room and says, 'This is the fact of this matter.' He walks into the adjoining room and tells the opposite to the group there. It is no wonder that people's disappointment has turned into dismay when it comes to Prime Minister Albanese.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to this issue, it doesn't get any more serious than an allegation of a misleading of this parliament and the Australian public by the Prime Minister of our country. This is not a concocted outrage or some interpretation of a quote. It's a completely and utterly scandalous approach by the Prime Minister, and he can't come to this chamber. I've watched seven prime ministers, who have come from both sides of this parliament, and I have never seen a circumstance where a prime minister of the day is accused of misleading this parliament and doesn't have the strength of character to come down here and to argue his corner—because he knows he's done the wrong thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The obligation under the standing orders and the practice of this place means that the Prime Minister at the first available opportunity needed to correct the record. Mr Speaker, as you would recall, I raised with you during the course of question time, when it was brought to my attention, the fact that the Prime Minister had selectively misquoted the director-general of ASIO. I don't believe that the Prime Minister has a leg to stand on here, and that's why he's not coming into this chamber. What it says, every hour that ticks by now where the Prime Minister doesn't come to this chamber, is that he can't be honest with the Australian public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Australian public believes that our country is heading in the wrong direction under the Albanese government. This government has made decisions which have not helped Australians but harmed Australians. Up until this point, it has been in relation to economic matters. People's grocery prices have gone through the roof under this government. The price that they're paying for insurance has gone through the roof. For their mortgage, interest rates have gone up 12 times, whilst interest rates are falling in New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has made wrong decisions, but, up until now, we haven't seen examples of decisions made by this government which have made our country less safe, except, of course, for Minister Giles's actions when he released 152 hardcore criminals who were noncitizens and had committed crimes against citizens—rape, paedophilia, armed robbery and murder. In error, the then minister released those people into the Australian community, and—you wouldn't believe it—they went on to commit more crimes. Who would have thought? The tragedy of that reality is that there is a human being, there is an Australian citizen who is a victim, behind each one of those crimes. We should never forget the face of that elderly lady in Perth who fell victim very early to one of these individuals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Giles has decided to bring people in on tourist visas from a war zone which is controlled by a listed terrorist organisation. The Prime Minister got up here and said to us that everyone had been checked through the ASIO process. They have not been. The selective quoting, by leaving out those words that Mr Burgess had given to David Speers over on <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span>, served the misrepresentation and backed up the position of the Prime Minister, which turned out to be false.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you bring people in on a tourist visa, it's like coming from the United States, from New Zealand or from other parts of the world where a visa is issued automatically. It's issued automatically without the checks and balances of somebody who would come here through the refugee and humanitarian program. The Prime Minister said to the Australian public that what they had done as a government under Minister Giles, by bringing people here on tourist visas, was akin to, or a replication of, what we had done when we brought people into Australia from Syria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The complete opposite is the case. We brought people here through the refugee and humanitarian program. It didn't take 24 hours to get a visa, as it does if you're a tourist. It took in some cases 12 months because we had to collect biometrics. We had to collect all of that information to check against databases. The Prime Minister will have you believe that somehow that's what happened here. It's not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look very quickly at what went towards covering up the fact of his mistake—the egregious and potentially very consequential mistake that he has made here. Let's look at what Mr Burgess said. He said they've gone through a visa process:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If they've been issued a visa, they've gone through the process. Part of that visa process is, where criteria hit, they're referred to my organisation and ASIO does its thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister missed those words: 'visa process is where criteria hit', and that is essentially undermining the credibility of this Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister has lost his integrity, he has lost his credibility, he has let down the Australian public, he has made us less safe, he is the weakest leader in our country's history and Australians are suffering because of it—not just economically and not just financially. This Prime Minister has now weakened the security settings in our country and he should be here defending himself.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  The motion is seconded. I didn't think that we'd get to this stage, but this is where we've got to. We've got to the fact that the prime minister now is as hopeless and hapless as the previous minister for immigration. As a matter of fact, they are peas in a pod. If you think about what has happened and the track record of both now, they're exactly the same</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> The former minister for immigration let 152 detainees out on the street and then came into this place and said they had all been issued with visas and had conditions placed on them. Then what did we find out down the track? That hadn't happened. FOIs showed us that some of them—and as the Leader of the Opposition has said, hardened criminals, murderers, sex offenders, child sex offenders—had been released without visas and without conditions placed on them. Did the Prime Minister, when he knew about that, require the former minister for immigration to come in here and admit that he had misled this parliament? No, he didn't. And now we know why, because if he had required him to do that, he would be in here today doing exactly the same thing. Yet where is he? Where is he? No-one knows. And what has he been accused of? It is not just misleading the parliament in some form, which is sort of irrelevant. What he has done is he has misquoted the director-general of ASIO. How can you not quote the director-general of ASIO in the correct form and think that you can get away with it? I'm glad the new minister for immigration is here because I hope to hell, for the Australian people's sake, that he isn't as hopeless and hapless as the previous minister for immigration and the prime minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what the prime minister has done. He was asked a very simple question, which goes to the No. 1 priority of this government: was everyone who came into this country from the Gaza war zone properly given a security check—every single one of them? And the prime minister said, 'Yes, they had.' Now we know that is not the case, and there is nothing that the new minister for immigration can show us or prove to say that what the Prime Minister has said was correct. The Prime Minister stands condemned today, the former minister for immigration stands condemned today, and what we will wait to hear now is whether the new minister for immigration has any explanation for two things. The first is: where is the Prime Minister and why won't he come and defend his honour? Because he knows he's wrong. He knows he has misled this place. The second thing we want to hear from the new immigration minister is: what was done to make sure that Australians are going to be kept safe from the people that have come in from the Gaza war zone? If we don't hear answers to those two things, then you might as well not get up and say anything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that will be very interesting to see while you're here defending the Prime Minister is whether the Prime Minister will come in to listen to the new minister for immigration defend him. Will he? Do you reckon he will? What do you think? I've got a feeling that the PM won't turn up. He'll stay in his office watching on the television because he's gutless. He won't come in here and defend himself. That is weakness at its worst and that is why he stands condemned today.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Arts, Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Cyber Security, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  If there was ever a motion that said that the Leader of the Opposition is not fit for office, it's what he's put in writing right now. Let me just go to a couple of clauses. As Leader of the Opposition, he gets security briefings. In his previous portfolio as Minister for Defence, he received security briefings. In his portfolio before that, in home affairs, he received security briefings. So how on earth does someone with that sort of background move the following things in this parliament?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this resolution, he wants a public declaration letting visa applicants know if they're the subject of a security assessment. Just here in the privacy of the House of Representatives, he wants us to publicly let it be known if someone is being subjected to a security assessment right now. Instead of letting the agencies do it in their normal way, let's just, just between us, let it be known on the floor of the House of Representatives, where no-one else will hear. Name one time when anyone wanting to be Prime Minister has said something as idiotic as that. If you want to say you care about national security, the first thing you don't do, if you're conducting a security assessment on someone, is let them know. You don't ring them up and say: 'Hey, this is what we think we've got on you. This is what we think we're checking on you. Would you mind if we had a public conversation about it?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition knows this is madness, or at least he used to know that. But right now, when he sees the chance to get angry, when he sees the chance to have a fight, all the national security principles go completely out the window. The national security of Australia doesn't matter when it gets in the way of his political interest. Why else would he put something like that in a resolution?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it doesn't stop there. The next paragraph after that is even more bizarre. He wants a public answer to this: what are the criteria for ASIO to carry out a security assessment? So he wants everything that he may have been told in private briefings over a large proportion of his career to now become a public discussion on the floor of the House of Representatives. You do know that there are public galleries?—no aspersions on any of the people up there; I'm glad you're here. You do know that this is broadcast? I don't know who watches the broadcast. I don't know why people watch the broadcast from time to time, and I certainly don't know why anyone watches the broadcast when something as irresponsible as this is being put before the parliament. To have a public discussion on a national security issue about what criteria ASIO use and who is currently subjected to an assessment would have to be the most irresponsible thing you could do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not the first time this person has been irresponsible, because this lack of responsibility has paved his whole career. You only have to look at the time delay. It wasn't much more than the six-second delay on radio between Mike Burgess as the director-general of ASIO telling people to cool the temperature and this guy running along with a bucket of kerosene saying, 'Where can I throw it on the fire?' And he's got form on trying to divide the Australian community. Look at who he said he won't fight for. Look at who he said we should all be suspicious of. At the moment we've got a debate where he's wanting to go after Palestinians, but before that it was Africans, Lebanese people and Muslims. Granted he hasn't tried to declare war on every migrant community; he did stand up for white South African farmers. We remember that.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BURKE:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and let me put it in different terms: what would be the motive for someone saying that we should lower our national security principles and let visa applicants know if we're doing a security assessment on them? What would be the motive for that? I can't think of a single motive that's in the national interests of Australia. I can think of a motive that might be in the political day-to-day media-cycle interests of the Leader of the Opposition. But if he's willing to sacrifice the national security interests of Australia to try to get a grab up in social media now, then that's his motive. It's not the government's motive. It's not my motive. You won't find me saying that if we're conducting a national security assessment on someone we ought to do it publicly, that we ought to phone a friend and let them know we're doing it. You won't find this government doing that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what sort of motivation has somebody got? I've got to say, if those opposite reckon it's a proper motive, what's the proper motive in this? Is it to publicly disclose all the criteria that ASIO uses? Wow! In what universe does any security agency on the planet publicly disclose all its criteria? In what universe do they do that? Yet the Leader of the Opposition is calling for that to happen now. I must say, I haven't seen his shadow home affairs spokesperson call for something as off the wall as what's being moved in the House right now. I haven't heard his shadow defence spokesperson call for something like that. And we do share confidential briefings with the opposition. We do make sure that that's happened, as they did when we were in opposition. But to share it with the world, to share it on the floor of the House of Representatives, is one of the most irresponsible things—and he knows it. He knows this is the wrong thing to do. Do the security agencies for the United States make their criteria public? Which countries in the world, when they're conducting a security assessment on someone, let them know? With those opposite it's, 'Oh, the Prime Minister this; the Prime Minister that.' But name the countries that do it—because they don't. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition has moved this motion today because the man is irresponsible and a sook, and the country doesn't like either. People have never put up with someone who's a sook, someone who, because they're not on the treasury benches, because at a point in time they're not running the nation, is willing to have the most extraordinary tantrum. We've got used to the tantrums they throw on economic responsibility. We've got used to the fact that they'll throw a tantrum and if they can't be in charge of housing policy they'll try to stop houses from being built. We've got used to the fact that on policy issue after policy issue they'll vote with the Greens because they can't be in charge, that they'll throw their bat and ball in the air and go away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I never thought they'd play that game on national security. I never thought they'd play that game on our ASIO systems. I never thought they'd call for what has always been confidential and move a motion of the floor of the parliament saying that all this should be made public. I'm going after what he has put in writing and moved on the floor of this House. Look at the expression on the face of the Leader of the Opposition right now. It shows his attitude to national security. In contrast to that, we've got a government led by a prime minister that will not and has not compromised on national security, that will not and has not attacked our security agencies, a prime minister who has made sure that every step of the way we have kept the thresholds on national security that were already there. Whether we have been in government or opposition, I have never seen something as irresponsible as what is before the House right now. I move:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="157125" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:39</span>):  The Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 is a cornerstone of the Albanese Labor government's Future Made in Australia plan, designed to drive our country towards a new era of prosperity and resilience. This bill represents a major step forward in realising our vision for a prosperous future for all Australians. It brings us closer to achieving our goals and secures Australia's position in a shifting global economic and strategic landscape, particularly in light of this global transition to net zero. At a conference held in the United States in 2023, the economist and Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz told the assembly:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Every country has an industrial policy. The question is whether it's explicit, whether it's implicit, whether it's coherent, or whether it's incoherent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 11 April 2024, the Prime Minister announced that the Albanese Labor government would introduce a Future Made in Australia Act, signalling the explicit adoption of a new industrial policy for Australia that aims to capitalise on Australia's advantages and resources necessary for the clean energy transition. The new policy will see government taking a more active role alongside the private sector. Prior to the budget, the Treasurer stated that a future made in Australia would be just as much about Australia taking a place within emerging and preferential trading blocs as it would be about stimulating growth and promoting structural change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The world is undergoing an unprecedented transformation as we shift towards cleaner and more affordable energy sources. This transformation has been likened to the Industrial Revolution in terms of its impact and scale. The Prime Minister has rightly pointed out that we are at the centre of the biggest economic transformation in a century. In the midst of this tumultuous period, our path to prosperity is not just apparent; it is clear and it is achievable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is uniquely positioned with a remarkable set of advantages. We have geological, meteorological, geographical and geopolitical strengths that give us an unprecedented opportunity to benefit from the global net-zero economy. To ignore this opportunity would be a grave disadvantage to our country and to our future generations. This bill is about leveraging our strengths and ensuring that Australia's future growth is strategically aligned with our industrial, resources, skills and energy bases. We need to ensure that we harness our attractiveness as an investment destination to seize the jobs and opportunities presented by the clean energy transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The global landscape is evolving rapidly, and Australia must evolve with it. If we cling to outdated models and resist change, we risk falling behind and becoming poorer and more vulnerable. Our Future Made in Australia agenda is designed to meet these challenges head on. Our goal is not to manufacture the past but to power the future. We are committed to a strategy of engagement and investment, not retreat and protection. We will focus on attracting private investment, rather than replacing it, and we will seek to prosper from change, rather than merely protect ourselves from it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Made in Australia Bill is not just a piece of legislation; it's a bold blueprint for a thriving, resilient and sustainable future. At its heart are the three dynamic pillars that will shape Australia's economic destiny and steer us towards a greener, more prosperous horizon. The National Interest Framework is absolutely pivotal in pinpointing where Australia can truly excel in the net-zero economy and where we need to bolster our economic and security resilience. It is a strategic compass that ensures every investment aligns with our national interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sector assessment process is where the rubber meets the road. We are going to assess and understand what is holding back private investment in crucial sectors. By uncovering these barriers and tackling them head on, we are clearing a path for private investors to enter the net-zero transition. Treasury will lead this process with an uncompromising commitment to rigour, independence and transparency. These assessments will be laid out in parliament, making sure investors have a clear and accountable picture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The community benefit principles are nothing short of revolutionary. Our investments must do more than just fuel economic growth; they need to uplift our communities. There are five key principles. The first is to ensure that every investment will create high-quality jobs. We are talking about safe, well-paying jobs with excellent conditions—jobs that make a real difference in people's lives. It will build a skilled, inclusive workforce, will invest in training and open doors for everyone, ensuring broad participation and skill development. It will engage positively with local communities. This includes First Nations communities and those directly impacted by the transition. We're committed to meaningful engagement and positive impact. It will strengthen domestic industries by boosting local supply chains and industrial capabilities. We are building a robust, self-sufficient economy. It will ensure transparency and compliance. Our investments will be transparent and fully compliant with Australia's tax system, fostering trust and accountability. These principles will guide each program and will be fine tuned through extensive consultations to make sure they deliver genuine benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also rolling out the Future Made in Australia plans. These tailored plans will maximise the broader benefits of our investments, addressing local needs and seizing opportunities with absolute precision. Introducing the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund is another game changer. This fund will be the powerhouse behind emerging technologies in green metals, clean energy manufacturing and lower carbon fuels. It's designed to spark innovation and drive technological breakthroughs that will propel us into a sustainable future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Public investment is crucial, but it's just one piece of the puzzle. The real transformation will come from rallying private sector investment. We are looking at needing an additional $225 billion by 2050 to transition our energy system and seize net zero opportunities in heavy industries. The National Interest Framework and sector assessments are essential to unlocking this private investment. They will help us pinpoint barriers and opportunities, giving investors the clarity and confidence that they need. With Treasury's expert analysis and evidence based assessments guiding the way, we will ensure that private investors are not just informed but inspired to act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must remember that throwing money at the economy isn't enough. We need to be strategic about its deployment. The Community Benefit Principles will ensure our investments are not just economically smart but also socially responsible and inclusive. They will guide us in creating quality jobs, developing skills, engaging communities and strengthening our industrial base.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As these projects unfold our Future Made in Australia plans will be tailored to meet specific needs and we will consult widely to ensure these principles deliver real, tangible benefits. The Future Made in Australia Bill isn't just about change. It's about driving a profound transformation that will shape our country's future for the better. This is our chance to lead with vision, to invest wisely and to ensure our prosperity and security for generations to come. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst attending an event in my electorate of Pearce last week, the Prime Minister spoke about the importance and benefits of a future made in Australia. As the resource powerhouse of Australia, Western Australia has a central and vital role to play. For example, Western Australian gas and iron ore has built our nation's wealth. There are WA metals, minerals and resources, WA universities, research and technology and WA businesses and workers. The global respect that our skills and knowledge command is absolutely admirable. Time and time again, Western Australia has embraced new technology and the productivity gains that come with it. This is a compelling combination of the strength that Western Australia brings to the table. It is also powerful proof that Australia can absolutely compete and succeed in a changing global economy. The workers of Western Australia have learned new skills and achieved new standards in safety and sustainability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As it has grown and adapted, the resource industry has invested in regional communities that support it. They have created local jobs, upgraded local infrastructure and worked with traditional owners to create economic opportunity in remote communities. All of that should give us confidence and optimism for what's ahead because whilst it's true that the resource industry has been a great constant in Western Australia's economy and our national prosperity, it has achieved that by constantly evolving and adapting and by anticipating and shaping the next opportunity. That next opportunity is definitely now upon us. Western Australians know that a future is secured where living standards, wages and productivity rise together. Building an economy that is more competitive and more resilient means working together to shape the future, not waiting for the future to shape us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our $22.7 billion budget investment demonstrates our commitment to this agenda. Public investment will pave the way, and private capital will drive the transformation. The Future Made in Australia agenda is an investment and growth strategy designed to provide investors with the clarity, certainty and cooperation that they need from the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The time to act is now. The world is changing rapidly, and the opportunities before us will not last forever. We have already spent a decade of denial and delay, and we cannot afford to waste another decade. The only thing Australia doesn't have is time to waste. That is why I commend the Future Made in Australia Bill to the parliament.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="288713" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BIRRELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  I rise to speak on the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024. I start by commending the government on the name of the bill; I think it's very clever. Once you dive into it, I think there are all sorts of issues that would be dangerous for Australia's manufacturing future. I will get to the legislation soon, but first it invites a discussion and a debate about how we encourage and invest in manufacturing in this country, what's worked in the past and what will work in the future. I think allowing the market to understand what consumers want and letting them manufacture is one thing, and what has been described by some media commentators as crony capitalism is another.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But first I want to invite all of those listening on a virtual tour of the industrial precinct of my home town of Shepparton. All members in this place are invited to come to Shepparton and getting the car for the real tour with me. We're going to drive down Old Dookie Road—and I do this to explain how manufacturing is thriving and what's led to it thriving. I think that can give us some pointers to the future. We drive down Old Dookie Road and turn to our right, and we see Noumi, a leading Australian producer of dairy and plant based milks, nutritional products and ingredients. Noumi sources the milk from the farms around the Goulburn Valley and creates, particularly in my area, UHT products that get exported and are also for the domestic market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You're looking at Noumi on your right—fantastic manufacturing facility. You look on your left and you see J Furphy &amp; Sons, an iconic Shepparton business. They great thing about J Furphy &amp; Sons is that they built the stainless steel tanks that set Noumi up to do the milk production and the food production that they do. So we've got a great little hub. We've got one business with innovation and know-how built up over 100 years that is supplying another business that is just getting going with some relatively new technologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we keep driving around, we will see Pental, recently acquired by the DuluxGroup. Pental has proudly supported Aussie homes for over 100 years, and they've got brands such as White King, Country Life, Velvet, Lux and Jiffy. Where would our homes be without those? They also have a contract manufacturing division, which manufactures to company specifications for private label or store brands. They were able to pivot during COVID to develop and produce a White King disinfectant spray and a Country Life antibacterial hand cleaner. There were in particularly high demand in China, and we had the capacity to do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we turn the corner and look around, and there's our favourite iconic company: SPC, the Shepparton Preserving Company. For over 100 years, they've been taking fruit from orchards and putting it into cans—more and more now, snack packs—as well as with tomatoes and all sorts of healthy processed foods that Australians and people around the world enjoy. I reiterate my invitation to everyone in this place to come and do the peach challenge: to try the imported Chinese products against the SPC in my office for all members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We drive past a company called Rubicon, which designed, built and installed water efficiency and management solutions in 20 countries around the world and makes irrigation efficiency equipment in Shepparton. We go to Campbell Soup, making a pantry staple. Everyone knows Campbell Soup. Then we turn around and see MC Pipes. Established in 1948, Midland Concrete, or MC, Pipes began life as a small concrete precast manufacturer of pipes, but they've grown into a huge business, and their pipes are necessary for the new housing developments we see around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that I have taken you on that bit of a tour is to have a think about how those businesses were set up and succeeded and what threatens them. Then we can discuss how we can have a real future manufactured in Australia. They need reliable and cheap energy, which they have had over many years. That's now threatened. Energy prices are going through the roof, particularly under this government. I am worried about where they are going to go in the future. I am worried about gas. I am worried about electricity. Most of them have done as much transformation to solar as they can, but they still need that base-load power. That threatens their very viability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industrial relations legislation that this government has put in place is making it very difficult for some of those businesses to manage. The red tape, the bureaucracy and what you have to go through with your workers is making it really difficult. The lack of flexibility is making it really difficult for people to run those businesses. The government investing in infrastructure is what set those businesses up. Instead of the government going in and saying, 'You should set up this kind of business,' or, 'You should set up that kind of business,' what the government did over 100 years ago was set up an irrigation system, saying, 'We'll get water to you and then you can decide what works and you make it work, whether it is growing peaches, apples or pears or having dairy products.' Then, all of a sudden, that creates a product and a commodity, which then creates manufactured and processed food. That's processed in a healthy way, I might add, with apples, pears and dairy. In some cases, there has been limited government support, and that is always leveraged off what a company decided was a good idea anyway. For example, the previous coalition government had modern manufacturing grants. That helped a company set up an abattoir called Greenham in Tongala in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I bring that up is that Australia has had a proud and strong manufacturing industry, and the coalition government always supported it. But the coalition will oppose this bill because, the more we hear about it, the more we see it as a plan for pork-barrelling, not for a strong economy. This is a plan for more government, not more business investment. It is a plan for more inflation at a time when Labor is already making it worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What our great manufacturing businesses need is affordable and reliable energy, flexible workplaces, less regulation and an incentive based tax system. That's what they need. What we're getting is policies on energy, industrial relations and tax that are making Australia a less attractive place to do business. We can see that because insolvencies are up and productivity is down. Those are facts. Insolvencies are up, productivity is down and businesses are struggling just to keep their doors open. So we see Labor's Future Made in Australia plan—great name—as a bit more about spin than delivery. Economist after economist has criticised this policy. The government can't solve the cost-of-living crisis by throwing hard-earned taxpayers' money around on ideological pet projects. This bill does nothing to alleviate the current pressures on struggling families and small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's in this legislation? These bills expand the role of Export Finance Australia and ARENA. They establish a national interest framework. That retrospectively underpins the government's Future Made in Australia policy. The accompanying omnibus bill expands Export Finance Australia's remit to fund domestic industries and nominate the Minister for Finance as an additional responsible additional minister. The omnibus bill also expands ARENA's functions from pure R&amp;D and demonstration into supporting manufacturing deployment and commercialisation. So this legislation really expands the role of government and ministers, and I think that's a dangerous thing to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Take ARENA, for example. It's always been a research and development agency. Labor in opposition opposed even expanding that remit to cover sensible net zero related R&amp;D expenditure into, for example, carbon capture and storage and blue hydrogen. But, now they are in government, they want to extend the remit even further into deployment of manufacturing because it suits the interests of their donors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill gives the minister for climate change the ability to boost its funding at the stroke of a pen, with no parliamentary oversight and no scrutiny. Have a think about what that could mean. The government can roll up to $3.98 billion out the door. Let's just think when that might be. Possibly before an election. I think we call that a slush fund where I'm from. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's own investments just don't stack up. The Productivity Commission says a $1 billion commitment to make more solar panels in Australia under the Albanese government's Future Made in Australia program should be retrospectively subjected to a tougher National Interest Framework test. At a time when productivity is down and struggling, I think we should listen to the Productivity Commission. We should also listen to them on irrigation and water in the Murray-Darling Basin. You might think I would say that, but that's something that enables business. The Labor government's attacks on the Murray-Darling Basin and those irrigation systems deter business, deter manufacturing and deter us making and growing future things in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To look at some examples, the Solar Sunshot program is already in trouble, with serious doubts we can produce globally competitive solar panels. The biggest booster of green hydrogen, Fortescue, is scaling back their ambitions for green hydrogen despite the promise of tax credits just for existing. Labor's production credits are failing to deliver for the struggling nickel industry, with the promise of future subsidies not holding back the tide of international price pressures and rising domestic costs through energy, tax and workplace laws. Key elements of Labor's Future Made in Australia agenda include the PsiQuantum contract, which bypassed the National Interest Framework and sector assessments. There's some serious questions to answer about decisions to make these investments. These things aren't necessarily bad. We don't know what the best technologies of the future are going to be. I would argue they're not necessarily for governments to completely decide, but to allow the market to find out. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must get back to economic basics. Australians want and deserve something better. In government, the coalition government would do three things. We want to steer our nation out of our current domestic crises. We don't want to simply talk about the challenges of our time; we want to meet them head-on with action to carve out a more secure future. More importantly, we want to make decisions that set up our nation for success for generations to come. We're looking to build a nation which is a mining, manufacturing and agricultural powerhouse and a leader in technology and innovation. That's what we do really well. When we set things up for private enterprise to succeed by making sure they have the tools to do what they want to do, then we see real success. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would argue that Australia has been on a pathway to success since the early 1980s. The Hawke-Keating government deregulated the economy. What we see now is the reregulation of the economy, and nowhere in the world has that worked. I recall a senator of this place, Mathias Cormann, talking about why he joined the Liberal Party. He said he joined the Liberal Party because it's the party of free enterprise. We in the Nationals are the party of free enterprise in the regions. He said it was because as he was driving around Europe as an older teenager of 18 or 19, he looked at what the policies had led to in East Germany and he looked at what the policies had led to in West Germany. In one, the government tried to get involved in everything, had its fingers in every pie, worked out who'd do this, who'd do that, who'd have this industry and who'd have that industry. West German governments, based on free market principles, were there to invest, support and provide energy, provide infrastructure, but then let the free market do its thing, finding out what consumers want, and creating products and services that consumers will then pay for. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even now when you drive around Germany you see the difference in prosperity. Prosperity is what it's all about—prosperity for our futures and prosperity for the generations ahead. We absolutely do need to reduce our emissions but there are better ways to do it than government's trying to pick winners. We're also seeking to help build a nation where the tax contributions from the surging industries help us to build the infrastructure of the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, we oppose this bill because it goes against the principles of the free market, the principles of allowing the market to decide what to invest in, the principles of innovation driving change not government deciding what it is. There is a complete lack of transparency about how this money would get allocated and who gets to allocate it. I think government's role is to create the right environment for business around energy, IR and infrastructure and then to just get out of the way. I don't think this bill advances that, and that's why we'll be opposing it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  The Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 is really exciting. This bill is about the future. It's about a bright future for Australia, for Australians, for Australian businesses, for Australian industry and for the Australian economy. This is about our future prosperity as a nation—a prosperous future for all Australians. It's about our future role in the world, a world that is transitioning to new energy and new opportunities. We can either bury our heads in the sand and pretend it isn't happening or see it for what it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The worldwide transition to net zero is a challenge, but it's also an enormous opportunity, particularly for a country like Australia, with our natural advantages: mineral deposits and abundant renewable resources—solar, wind and hydro. This bill is all about realising our genuine advantages and recognising that our future growth prospects lie at the intersection of our industrial, resources, skills and energy bases and our attractiveness as an investment destination so we can grasp the jobs and opportunities of the clean energy transition. It's about attracting private-sector investment to maximise the benefit to this country—well-paid, secure jobs, secure supply chains, and a secure role in the global net-zero economy. It's about addressing some of the challenges facing our island nation in a changing global and strategic landscape, such as sovereign capability and supply chain security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In South Australia, Premier Peter Malinauskas and the state Labor government are running a series of state prosperity forums. I recently attended one of these very well attended forums. The inspiring message being presented is how worldwide decarbonising is an opportunity for South Australia and how the South Australian government can position the state to be ready for this. The projects include the Northern Water project, which will deliver desalinised water to Olympic Dam and surrounds to facilitate copper mining without draining the artesian basin; and green hydrogen produced using excess solar and wind generated electricity, which South Australia already has in abundance and which can be used to make green iron and steel. Copper, iron and steel are all vital resources for electrification all around the world, and South Australia plans to capitalise on our natural assets to deliver prosperity to South Australians, in the form of well-paid, secure jobs, and prosperity for the state, in the form of value added product: green iron, steel and copper processed in South Australia. This is a great plan for South Australia. It's a great plan for environmentalists and those who are really concerned about climate change action and decarbonising. It is building industries that will contribute to the state's decarbonising but also to the world's energy transition. And it's great for business and industry because it's taking advantage of market opportunity and using our natural advantages to build big profitable businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The world is changing, and the pace of that change is accelerating as the planet moves to a future powered by cheaper and cleaner energy. As the Prime Minister has said, this change means we are in the middle of the biggest transformation in the global economy since the Industrial Revolution, and we can either ride the wave of change and benefit from it or pretend it isn't happening and get dumped by it instead. It appears those opposite would prefer to ignore opportunity when it comes knocking—ignore economic opportunity. South Australia is certainly prepared to ride the wave of change and make sure we benefit from it, and this bill is a major step in implementing the Albanese Labor government's Future Made in Australia agenda to deliver our country's next generation of prosperity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The world is changing, and Australia needs to change with it and position ourselves to take advantage of these changes. If we don't, the country will be poorer and more vulnerable. We'll be more dependent on overseas supply chains, with profits flowing offshore to countries that have better prepared themselves. It will make us vulnerable to geopolitical instability, and this is not the future we want for this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a unique combination of geological, meteorological, geographical and geopolitical comparative advantages, and we know it would be an egregious breach of our responsibilities as a government if we didn't play this winning hand. This bill is all about realising our genuine advantages and recognising that our future growth prospects lie with our industrial, resources, skills and energy bases. This makes us an attractive investment target so we can build industries, create well-paid, secure jobs and harness the opportunities of the clean energy transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our goal here is to power the future. Our strategy is to engage and invest, to attract private investment, to prosper from change. This bill brings us closer to the prosperous future for all Australians that we know is there for the taking. And it helps us secure Australia's place in the shifting global economic and strategic landscape on the back of the global transition to net zero. We want Australia to be a place that makes things, as it did in the past.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year, Harvard researchers do an assessment of the economic complexity of 133 major economies around the world. Economic complexity is basically a measure of the value-added contained in a country's exports—how much of our export income comes from products that require knowledge. For instance, digging up iron ore and exporting it requires relatively less knowledge input than also processing it into steel and then into a car, to use a simplistic example. Higher complexity is also a measure of the economic potential of a country. Economic complexity not only correlates with GDP per capita; it also predicts future economic growth. Of the 133 countries measured by the Harvard researchers, Australia rates 93rd. We sit just below Uganda and just above Pakistan—this despite having a GDP per capita that is 68 times larger than Uganda's and 40 times larger than Pakistan's.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last decade alone, under those opposite, Australia has fallen 12 places in economic complexity. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Atlas of E</span><span style="font-style:italic;">conomic </span><span style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span style="font-style:italic;">omplexity</span> notes that Australia's worsening complexity has been driven by a lack of diversification in exports. Our economy is less complex than would be expected, given that our GDP per capita is the 12th highest in the world. Given the lack of complexity in our current export products, doing more of the same is unlikely to change anything. We need instead to look at the world around us, at the current trajectory and future needs, and strategically move into areas that we know will grow. We need to start making things in Australia again. And instead of fighting an uphill battle on products that other countries are already experts in, we need to use our competitive advantages to get ahead of the market in the new decarbonised world economy: green energy, green steel, green aluminium—energy transition products.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know my electorate of Boothby is ready for this. Already we have the internationally recognised Tonsley Innovation District, home to over 150 high-tech modern manufacturing businesses. The entire district runs completely on solar and wind power generated on site. It's also home to the largest hydrogen electrolyser in the Southern Hemisphere, where excess solar and wind energy is stored as hydrogen that is exported to Whyalla every week. And this government is investing in the Factory of the Future at Tonsley, and the South Australian Labor government is putting in a technical college at the same site, in addition to the existing TAFE campus and the campus of Flinders University. We know the future is bright for these industries, and they will be needing more skilled workers. Exposure to these industries during training is a fantastic opportunity for students to get a head start and for businesses to identify the workers they need to employ so they can grow their businesses. That's what this bill is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation has three pillars. The first is a national interest framework. This will identify sectors where we have a sustained comparative advantage in the new net zero economy, or an economic resilience and security imperative to invest. The national interest framework outlines criteria to assess sectors to determine where it is in Australia's national interest to unlock private investment at scale. It looks at economic security and resilience, considering where domestic sovereign capability is necessary to protect our national security interests or to ensure that our economy is sufficiently resilient to shocks. It also focuses on net zero transformation, where industries support global decarbonisation and there is a reasonable prospect of sustained comparative advantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second pillar is a robust sector assessment process to help us better understand and break down barriers to private investment in key areas of the economy. This transparent, Treasury-led analysis will look at the extent that sectors align with the National Interest Framework, and these assessments will be tabled in parliament to support transparency and rigorous decision-making and to help deliver value for money. Public investment will be an important and substantial part of our plan, unlike the plan of those opposite, who were unable to attract private investment interest in their eye-wateringly expensive, far-fetched nuclear plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important role for public investment will be to unlock the vast amount of private sector capital that we will need to transition the energy system and realise the net zero opportunity in heavy industries. The framework and the sector assessments will be instrumental here, identifying the barriers to private investment and opportunities to address those barriers, informed by Treasury's expert analysis and evidence-based assessments—on top of their normal policy advice—and helping private investors to make considered decisions, confident that they know where the government stands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third pillar is a set of community benefit principles that will ensure that public investment and the private investment it generates leads to returns and also to stronger communities. The three pillars will work together to help us build a more diversified and a more resilient economy, powered by renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Future Made in Australia Bill is about protecting the interests of this country through stronger domestic industrial capabilities, sovereign capability and stronger local supply chains. It's about developing a more complex economic offering in line with our capability and know-how and about taking advantage of our natural assets—abundant renewable resources, solar, wind, hydro and critical mineral deposits. As always with this government, this is also about generating good-quality, secure, well-paid jobs and careers for Australians. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLCOX</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024, but, unfortunately, unless there's a change of government, there is to be no future made in Australia. There is simply none. Every time the Albanese Labor government is faced with a challenge or faced with some questions, they come up with the wrong answers. We have a major security issue in this current situation. The No. 1 thing a federal government and a prime minister should do is look after our borders and keep our people safe. Unfortunately, they are failing on many fronts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Giles, the previous immigration minister, let 152 detainees out and, most of the time, didn't know where they were. Now, the Prime Minister is looking to let Gazan refugees from that war-torn nation into our country without the right checks and balances. There is no chance of having any future made in Australia unless we get our borders, our immigration and our security under control, and we need to keep Australians safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point is energy. The Albanese policy around energy is a disaster. Electricity prices are going through the roof. This is after we were promised on 97 occasions that power prices would come down if an Albanese Labor government was elected. It simply hasn't happened. This is all due to the reckless race to renewables. It's making power prices go through the roof. The other thing with renewables is that it's an intermittent and unreliable energy source, which simply does not help the manufacturing industry whatsoever. The manufacturing industry needs power 24/7 and renewables cannot provide it. Solar only works when the sun is shining. Wind turbines only work when the wind is blowing. Of course, they are now talking about back-up batteries. How long do they last? Point to me anywhere else in Australia, or anywhere else in the world, where batteries will make manufacturing work? I'd be very interested if someone can do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Manufacturing requires a large amount of capital expenditure. It's a huge amount of capital expenditure. So when the manufacturing industry pays for capex, whatever industry they're in, they need to be able to use that 24/7. It's the only way that they can make their repayments. It's the only way they can make their business model work. You simply can't do that with renewable energy. Then I hear those opposite saying: 'We're going to supplement with hydro. When the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine, we are going to use hydro.' Again, it is a weather-dependent form of energy. There is no energy created out of pumped hydro. All it does is go round and round. You buy it on the margin. That's how it works. We need it 24/7. That's why we need to keep our coal-fired power stations going and have a look at investing in new technology, nuclear technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Business is moving offshore. We are losing businesses. I was actually talking to a large-business owner who doesn't want to be named but said: 'Andrew, the situation is that capital is very portable now. We can move it all over the world. We're not going to invest it in Australia if there is this unreliability of energy and unreliability of government.' I said, 'I fully get it.' I'm a farmer by trade. We used to pack tomatoes by hand. We used to pick the colours and the sizes by hand. Then an electronic grader came in. That's the innovation we have in this country. We can have innovation and we can actually make sure that we can develop things and improve. But we can't do that if we haven't got our energy under control. We have a huge resources sector in Australia. There's lots of coal and uranium still in the ground, as well as precious minerals. We need to be mining these resources and using them. We should have the cheapest form of energy any place in the world. That's what we'll do if a future coalition government gets in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'Future Made in Australia' should be one of the greatest pieces of legislation the government can introduce in the House; however, don't let the title confuse you. This Albanese Labor government continues to confirm day in and day out that it simply is just not up to the job. How can I, in good faith, support this legislation when I know for a fact that the Labor and Greens in coalition with the unions have destroyed manufacturing in this country? This legislation will do nothing for jobs and nothing for the economy. This legislation, put in plain context, is a plan for more bureaucracy, not for business investment. Just last week, the RBA advised the government to stop this fake spending as it is fuelling inflation and hurting Australian. So what does this incompetent Albanese Labor government do? It just keeps spending your money. It would be laughable if it weren't so serious.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Already the idea of this legislation is raising serious doubts about the PsiQuantum contract. This taxpayer funded investment bypassed the National Interest Framework. Can you believe that? It bypassed it. It has some serious questions to answer about the decision to even make that investment. Minister Husic decided to invest in this business independent of any department appraisal, analysis or recommendation. Treasury was not consulted. The subsequent analysis has said that it is not a sound investment. Treasury was not consulted, and their subsequent analysis has said, 'This is not a sound investment.' Millions of dollars of taxpayer' money and a decision made by a minister who has never owned or run a business—great idea, eh? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">
                    </span>The cost of energy, the cost of power in this country is out of control. We need to invest in nuclear technology—technology that will create power 24/7. That's what we need to do and that is what manufacturing requires for us in this country. We need better IR laws. Every time a Labor government comes in they change the IR laws and make it more difficult for business. How can business prosper, how can they go forward if they're hamstrung by more and more difficult laws?</span>

We have a company called Gilmour Space in my electorate of Dawson which is waiting on approval from the space agency. They've been waiting for a long time now and that's the only thing that is stopping them from launching their rocket. This is sovereign manufacturing of rockets—of potential missiles to defend our country—right here in this country. Why would you not support that and get behind it so we can (1) defend ourselves and (2) put some more satellites up into space? That is manufacturing right here in this country. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  Members of the Australian Defence Force do a fantastic job. Some of our veterans may be wounded, injured or ill because of their service, and businesses do a great job in supporting these veterans. These businesses that contract to a government department have every right to expect to be paid in a reasonable timeframe, but this government is failing to ensure that these cleaners, gardeners and home-service providers, who do important work in supporting our veterans, are getting paid. My office has been inundated with messages from veterans and these service providers because the situation is creating extreme angst in the veteran community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One veteran of 40-plus years has told me he may lose his yard maintenance provider because DVA has failed to pay its bills. A cleaning provider has told me it suffered months of nonpayment from DVA and is now forced to consider suspending its services. A local mowing franchise says thousands of dollars in unpaid invoices is making it increasingly difficult for small businesses to support these veterans. No veteran should lose their support services, and no veteran should have this angst imposed upon them. These small businesses shouldn't be put through financial hardship. I call on the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to immediately resolve this issue. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  I rise today to pay tribute to Coalcliff Surf Life Saving Club, who celebrate their 100-year anniversary this year. This centennial is a testament to the unwavering commitment of club members, who have watched over Coalcliff Beach for 100 years. Throughout countless hours of training, patrolling and community engagement, Coalcliff Surf Life Saving Club has become an integral part of the Illawarra, embodying the spirit of community service and leaving a legacy that truly reflects the club's enduring impact on our coastal community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It might be one of the Illawarra's smallest surf lifesaving clubs, but Coalcliff has proven mighty resilient over the past century. Since its inception in the early 1920s, the club has endured plenty of trials and tribulations. Disaster first struck in 1974, when the clubhouse and all historic records were destroyed by a wild storm. Tragedy struck again in early 2020, when all records, which had been stored at the club secretary's home for safekeeping, were lost to a fire. However, the town's surf lifesavers didn't let these setbacks diminish the club's spirit and kept a common goal of keeping the community safe. </span>

I was thrilled to join in your celebrations and present a certificate of recognition from Prime Minister Albanese. It was a fabulous event to be a part of.

The Leader of the Opposition last week asked the Prime Minister a question about reduced costs for working families and what else he's delivered on, and the Prime Minister went off on a tangent that addressed none of the questions that the Leader of the Opposition asked.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's review what this government has actually achieved in its two years in office. It has achieved 12 interest rate increases, a 22 per cent surge in electricity prices and an 11 per cent or more jump in the cost of food and groceries. It's very different from what the Prime Minister promised in the lead-up to the election. One of the things that the Prime Minister did say in his response to the Leader of the Opposition's question last week was that they delivered cheaper childcare. It's good to see the shadow childcare minister at the table, because she can readily confirm that out-of-pocket childcare costs have actually increased by 8.4 per cent in the last six months. Australians are working harder than ever to make ends meet, and once again the Prime Minister fails to acknowledge the costs of his government's failure.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  The Robertson electorate is home to many distinguished artists, musicians, actors and other creative Australians. Two outstanding artists who call Avoca Beach on the Central Coast home are Carol Marando and Jon Ellis. Carol and Jon met while on a painting trip through Central Australia during the nineties. They were both developing their artistic skills and taking inspiration from the colours and landscapes of the Australian outback. Settling in together on the Central Coast, Carol and Jon raised their two children in the region and have both established successful arts enterprises. For 20 years, Carol produced exquisite jewellery which was sold throughout Australia and the world. She was also involved with glass bead making, having learned many of these skills through her fine arts education after school. Nowadays, Carol is an excellent ceramic potter, with many of her works highly treasured. Carol and Jon both continue to have very successful professional lives. Jon holds weekly art classes in his home studio space and teaches painting at the Gosford Regional Gallery. Carol also divides her time between her private practice and the latest passion, ceramics. You'll find Carol selling her works at the Mousehole and at 5 Lands Artists Collective's stall at the Avoca markets. I would like to take this opportunity to commend Carol Marando and Jon Ellis on their services to arts on the Central Coast and throughout Australia. Thank you for making our community a brighter and more exciting place to live.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I cannot believe we still need to say this in 2024, but immigrants and refugees are an essential part of the fabric of this country, and I am sick of the dog-whistling that is coming from the coalition. Any semblance of liberalism within the LNP evaporated last week and again this morning when the Leader of the Opposition used this place to call for an end to accepting refugees fleeing the war on Gaza. These are human beings we are talking about. They did not choose to be bombed. They did not choose to lose their families. They want the same as every person living here: to lead a life free of conflict and to find success and prosperity for themselves and their families.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So who is the dog-whistling from the LNP for? Well, it's for themselves. It's an attempt to distract from their bumbling incompetence in the New South Wales council elections. The LNP can't seem to fill out a form on time, so they've decided to throw communities of colour, refugees and people who have immigrated to Australia under the bus instead. It is sickening.</span>

We need to end offshore detention and introduce time limits for onshore detention so that people are not kept in eternal limbo. These are human beings, and it is well beyond time we treated them as such.</span>

For Afghanistan, it was a long and very hard-won independence after nearly a century of colonial rule, internal instability and major wars commencing in 1839, 1878 and 1919. Even after independence, their freedom was constantly disrupted, with internal conflicts and later invasions by the USSR in 1979 and the US in 2001. The resilience of the Afghan people has become one of their great strengths. Today over 72,000 Afghans have settled in Australia, where finally they have found the peace and freedom their ancestors longed, fought and died for and which is still being denied to the Afghan people under Taliban rule.</span>

Afghan leaders at the event spoke of the ongoing oppression of Afghan people, particularly women, under the Taliban rule in their homeland and their concerns for family members who remain stranded overseas. On a more positive note, they spoke of the freedoms and opportunities they have embraced in Australia and their commitments to building a prosperous future for all Australians.</span>

Branches of RAR across Indi have sponsored families—particularly women and children from Afghanistan—who are now settled in towns like Mansfield, working in and contributing to the town. A recent Afghan 'fest for freedom' raised $4,000 to continue this important work. Regularly, on a Friday afternoon, my staff and I will hear the beeping horns outside our Wangaratta electorate office as RAR volunteers hold 'honk for refugees' signs on the major intersection in town.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This activism is repeated across the many chapters of Rural Australians for Refugees working across Indi and across regional Australia. Through music trivia nights, house concerts, film nights and more, these groups are having a real impact. As refugee numbers rise across the world, these volunteers are working locally while thinking globally. I'm so proud to represent the volunteers from Rural Australians for Refugees and the groups in Albury-Wodonga, Alexandra, Mansfield, Benalla, Strathbogie Shire, Wangaratta and Yackandandah. Through their words and—most importantly, through their actions they show unequivocally that refugees are welcome here.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My husband had prostate cancer, which he addressed in the nick of time. He was able to deal with this because he was proactive. Unfortunately, this is not the approach of many men. Therefore, we must continue to increase the primary prevention and awareness-raising strategies. I thank Michelle Terry, CEO of Movember, Professor Simon Rice, Global Director of the Movember Men's Health Institute, and my parliamentary colleagues for publishing this comprehensive and timely report. There is more work to do, and I will advocate for the recommendations in the report.</span>

From instilling resilience and practical skills to fostering lifelong friendships, their mission and impact extend far beyond cookies and badges. In fact, the Girl Guides are the largest youth organisation for girls and women in our Sunshine State, with almost 3,000 youth members and a thousand volunteer leaders and adult members.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Saturday, I joined the Mt Gravatt Girl Guides in repainting their facilities. It was a big job, but thanks to Cheryl's organisation and coordination we were able to get the job done and have fun too. Shout out to Glynis, Carol and Kathy, who are also from the Girl Guides. Kathy was also one of my school teachers. Thank you to Pinky Singh, our LNP candidate for Mansfield, for coming out in support of our guides and rallying an army of volunteers. Thanks also to Taubmans and Dulux for donating the paint, and to Bunnings at mt Gravatt for their work platforms. It was certainly a community effort. The and care put into this project is a testament to the contribution that the Girl Guides make to our locals in Mt Gravatt and the surrounding suburbs. I hope this fresh look brings new energy and pride to the timeless mission of the Girl Guides.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Men's Sheds, I've seen the importance of men's sheds in communities right across this nation. The Whittlesea Men's Shed, a cornerstone of our local community, has recently expanded its reach by launching a women's shed program. The initiative provides local women with the opportunity to connect, learn new skills and engage in shared activities with a supportive and collaborative environment. It's a fantastic example of how these spaces can evolve to meet the needs of the entire community. Men's sheds have long been a place for men to gather, to share their stories and to support one another, and it's wonderful to see the spirit of community being extended to the women in the area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The women's shed program, operating during times when the men's shed is not in use, ensures that the women have access to the tools, equipment, space, and knowhow necessary for their projects. It has already provided lots of positive feedback from the participants, saying that it's a valuable opportunity to connect with other women in our community while learning new and valuable skills. As the Whittlesea Men's Shed continues to thrive, the addition of the women's shed program marks a new chapter in its history, one that emphasises skill sharing and the importance of community connection. So congratulations to everyone that has been involved in this. I wish you every success and would like to see this program spread wider.</span>

Finalists were chosen by a committee of local tradespeople and employers.

Jack is completing his Certificate III in Sports Turf Management with Yarra Valley Racing and was recognised for his strong work ethic, eagerness to learn and positive attitude. Hayden is a fourth-year landscape apprentice with RYCOR Landscapes and was nominated for his leadership, hard work, reliability and genuine character. It is so important that young people know that university is not the only pathway to success, and I will continue to support Casey's local trades.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  I'm proud to share some fantastic news for the Hunter Valley and for Australia. The Hunter's own Liz Silkman has been named the Australian Halliday Winemaker of the Year for 2025, one of the highest honours in the Australian wine industry. Liz is the first Hunter Valley winemaker to ever be awarded this title from one of the world's most respected wine critics. This award is a huge achievement not just for Liz but for the Hunter Valley, which as we know is recognised as the best wine region in the world. Her Silkman Blackberry Semillon 2023 was also named Semillon of the Year, with an exceptional score of 98 out of a possible 100.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Liz's success is a reflection of her hard work, passion and deep connection to the Hunter. Her wines capture the true essence of our region, showcasing the unique flavours and qualities that make the Hunter Valley so special. Liz has dedicated her career to perfecting her craft, and this award confirms that the Hunter Valley produces some of the finest wines in the world. This recognition is not only a win for Liz but also for everyone in the Hunter. It shines a spotlight on our region and strengthens our reputation as a world-class wine destination. It's a proud moment for all of us who call the Hunter home. Congratulations, Liz, on this incredible achievement. You're an absolute superstar. Keep up the great work. I look forward to seeing what you do next year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  In the 2021-22 budget, the former coalition allocated $873.2 million as part of our National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan. Some of that money was to go to building a headspace centre in Caloundra. That was supposed to have been opened in July of 2023. We're now in August of 2024, and this government has not even chosen a site. According to the Lancet study that was announced just last week, Professor Pat McGorry, who was the lead author of that report, said that governments around the world are 'failing young people'. This government is no exception—he didn't say that; those are my words. He said, 'Over the last 15 to 20 years we've have seen an alarming rise, a 50 per cent increase, in the need for care in this age group.' That's the 15-year-old to 20-year-old age group. We saw the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare come out with a study recently and say that, for the 15-year-old to 24-year-old age group, the leading cause of death is suicide, yet, over 12 months later, this government—this health minister—is still letting down the young people of Caloundra. I call on him to get cracking and get it open.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  Last Friday, I gathered with hundreds of others, including many from this place, to celebrate the life of our friend Sarah Carter. Sarah was many things to many people. She was a three-time mayor of Maribyrnong City Council and the first woman in the council's history to receive emeritus status. She was the pioneer of the Save the Children's Australian regional leadership initiative, where she took parliamentarians around the world to spotlight where humanitarian assistance was needed. She was a fierce advocate for women and gender equality, a future parliamentarian and a fantastic friend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will always be indebted to Sarah for convincing us to travel to Myanmar in 2017, where we visited the IDP camps in Rakhine state and saw the efforts of aid workers and humanitarian assistance programs firsthand. Sarah had an incredible ability to work collaboratively with everyone, no matter their political background; that's a rare skill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although she was imbued with Labor values, she would reach across the political aisle to engage with people from every part of politics. I note the member for Riverina's kind words that he gave at the service—and thank him for them—a testament to Sarah's ability to bring people together. The loss of Sarah is unfair and unfathomable, because her energy and enthusiasm was boundless. Her commitment to community was infectious. Every time you were in her presence you left feeling truly enriched.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sarah achieved so much in just 45 years, but I know how much more she had to give and how much change she had left to make. That is really the greatest sadness for the world that she leaves. It is now incumbent upon all of us who knew and loved Sarah to continue her life's work in making the world a better place for women and children. Vale, Sarah. We will always miss you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  The southern Gold Coast is home to many veterans and their families, who have given so much for their country in often the most unimaginable of circumstances. Today, I again reaffirm my commitment to them, as I did in my first speech in this place, and I thank our veterans for their service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each year on 18 August we pause to remember all those Australians who fought and fell on foreign soil during the Vietnam War. Almost 60,000 Australians served during the 10 years of our involvement in the Vietnam War. Tragically, 523 died and more than 3,000 were wounded. Tragically still, many returned home either ill or injured, and many still today carry the scars, physical and emotional, that they gained through their time in the war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, I joined with Vietnam veterans at Burleigh Heads to commemorate their service and show my respect. It was, again, a very moving service, led this year by RSL Burleigh Heads sub-branch president, Graham Mowbray. I'd like to thank Graham and also the former president of the Burleigh Heads sub-branch, George Karsai, for their service to our nation and to our local community. To Lyn Glass, who has been secretary for about seven years now: I thank you for helping make the day a success and for your enormous contribution to the sub-branch. My thanks also go to the executive and members of the sub-branch for their service. Lest we forget.</span>

Like 47 per cent of my electorate, I am a proud migrant who now calls Australia home. My electorate is named after former prime minister Harold Holt, who, in 1966, removed discrimination against non-white citizenship applications like mine. The Whitlam government advanced this progress in the 1970s by dismantling the last remains of the White Australia policy. Since then, our government and society have worked to build a multicultural Australia where everyone is respected, regardless of where they were born. </span>

When you dog whistle and undermine our multicultural compact, it offends me. Labor will always stand with all Australians, no matter where they were born.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Labor's homegrown inflation crisis, driven by government spending, is leading Australians to neglect their health. Dining out has gone and people are choosing between heating their homes and eating a meal. Now, in desperation, they are also sacrificing their health. Three in five Australians are delaying visits to their GP because they worry they cannot afford it, while three in four people say that the cost of living has impacted their health decisions. According to the Australian Healthcare Index's survey of over 9,000 Australians, almost one in three Australians are delaying necessary health tests and more than 50 per cent are avoiding the dentist due to money worries. People are taking health risks because the Prime Minister has broken promises to cut electricity bills, to provide cheaper mortgages and to ensure that families will be better off on the cost of living under Labor. Electricity prices are up 22 per cent, there have been 12 mortgage rate hikes, and food and grocery prices are up by more than 11 per cent. Now Labor's homegrown cost-of-living crisis is putting Australian health at risk.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  Early educators shape and change lives, and we can never thank them enough for what they do, but we can make sure that they are properly valued and fairly paid. I had the pleasure of visiting the Casuarina Childcare Centre and speaking with them about the Albanese government's funding of a 15 per cent wage increase for early childhood education and care workers. The boss of the centre is Alice Casimiro Branco, who's been working in the sector and working in the union for over 40 years. It was great to visit her and her hardworking staff and to thank them for all those who campaigned so hard to lift the low wages of workers and educators in this sector.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A typical ECEC educator who is paid at the award rate will receive a pay rise of at least $103 per week, increasing to at least $155 per week from December next year. But, importantly, this agreement will also keep fees down for families in Darwin and Palmerston in my electorate and around Australia. Our cheaper childcare policy has already delivered increased subsidies to local families, but this wage increase will be tied to a commitment from the centres themselves to limit their fee increases to no more than 4.4 per cent. This policy is also good for business, because we'll have more people who want to go back into business and into work able to do so.</span>

They've never been worse off than they are now. Housing is up 15 per cent. Rents are up 15 per cent. Electricity—remember that promise from the Prime Minister?—is up 22 per cent, not down $275—no. Gas is up 25 per cent. Australians have faced 12 mortgage rate increases. So, if you've got a mortgage of $750,000, I'm sure you're aware that you are $35,000 worse off under this Prime Minister. Household savings have collapsed by nearly 10 per cent. Living standards have decreased in this country by eight per cent. Shame on you. Small businesses are shutting their doors, and we've seen a record number of insolvencies. Real wages continue to go backwards, and unemployment is at its highest level since the election. Unfortunately, Australians looking for some kind of relief won't find any from this Prime Minister. This government's reckless spending and economic mismanagement have left Australian households and businesses in the lurch. Australians need real, targeted cost-of-living relief, and they are not getting it from this Prime Minister. They are not getting it from this Labor government, Prime Minister.</span>

The PM is James Bond, of course—the Sean Connery version, with humble working-class beginnings, old-school sensibility and a long career in high office. What about the arch-villain? The Leader of the Opposition has a striking temperamental alignment with Dr No. But, in many ways, it's the villain's accomplice that is the most interesting figure. The most famous was Oddjob. Who's the accomplice? The Leader of the Greens, of course, assisting Dr No in delaying important legislation. Why? First, 'Oddjob' is a name very amenable to hyphenation: 'Hello, I'm Odd-job.' Second, Oddjob's signature tool, the top hat, is the perfect embodiment of the modern inner-city Green, unconcerned with cost of living. The top hat used by Oddjob was manufactured by Lock &amp; Co. to be particularly rigid and stiff, like the Greens' ideological stance. This is reflected in opposition to Help to Buy, build-to-rent and HAFF—delayed for many months. Half of these are in the Greens' own manifesto. The Greens never saw a housing policy or a project in their own patch they didn't want to block. But fear not, PM. <span style="font-style:italic;">MythBusters</span> actually tested the impact of Oddjob's hat and found that it bounced off the head of the statue in the real world. The bills eventually pass. The budget measures actually help people in need. As <span style="font-style:italic;">MythBusters</span> showed, ideological purity and attention-seeking don't actually achieve anything in the long run.</span>

The Prime Minister deliberately misquoted the Director-General of Security to suit his version of why the government hasn't properly screened people coming out of the terrorist controlled Gaza strip. The Prime Minister was also tricky in saying that the screening processes his government uses are the same as the coalition used, when that turns out to be completely untrue. Isn't this why Australians are disappointed in the Prime Minister and now saying that he is incompetent and dishonest?</span>

At the heart of our Future Made in Australia plan is a clear vision. We want Australia to make more things here. I would have thought that that should have been pretty uncontroversial, but, at this stage, both the coalition and their broader friends in the 'no-alition', the Greens, are saying that they won't support the Future Made in Australia legislation. It's legislation which could make Australia a renewable energy superpower; legislation to make our economy more resilient and more secure; legislation making it easier for companies to invest in new projects and create new jobs here, making the most of our natural resources, but also making the most of our talent, our labour skills, which we have here as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about an optimistic approach to where Australia is headed. It's about our respect for Australian scientists and innovators. It's about our belief in the boundless potential of our regions and our resources. But some on the opposite side want to continue to talk Australia down. We want to build Australia up.</span>

                  </a>  I want to deal with character descriptions in general because this is a feature that keeps coming up time and time again, particularly with descriptors. I'm going to address the issue of character descriptions in questions. These have been ruled out of order in the past, including by myself, and they're not appropriate. From now on, just so that everyone's clear, there will be no words in questions ascribing a character reference to a minister or prime minister. I'm giving clear warnings. I'm following earlier practice that was done by previous Speakers. I've taken this approach on 1 August. Speaker Smith took this approach on 18 March 2021, and Speaker Jenkins took this approach on 2 June 2021. Just so that everyone is crystal clear, including the Leader of the Opposition, if you put a character description at the end of the question it's going to be ruled out of order and we will move to the next question. Okay?</span>

Alex Dyson knows all about the member for Wannon, and it will be interesting to see what happens at the next election when people make a judgement about his character. If I were the member for Wannon, I would be knocking on doors. I would be doorknocking on the weekends. That's if he gets around to nominating. I'll give you some advice: don't leave it to the New South Wales branch!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The worst thing about this is that the member for Wannon should know better. He should know—and does know, of course—that Israel in fact closed the Rafah Border Crossing in May. He knows also that the ASIO director has very clearly spoken about the responsibility that politicians have with their language. He knows that full well. He also knows the diligent way that our security agencies do their jobs. He should also know the risk of serious division that the ASIO director-general has warned about.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also asked about interviews on Sky News. I hope that he also saw Mariam Dawwas, a Gazan refugee, in an interview with Tom Connell and Andrew Clennell. She had this to say: 'It was a long journey. We were hopeful that we would come to a place of peace. We are here in Australia, living here. It was a very, very hard experience. I lost my dad. We lost our dad during the war because of a lack of medical care and we weren't able to get him to the hospital.' She went on to say: 'I have lived my life in Gaza. I don't have any political affiliation with any of the political parties in Gaza.' She went on to say: 'I am myself a journalist. My sister is a doctor. I have a dentist brother and a dentist sister. So I am aware we are not the exception. We are normal people in Gaza, very normal people, not terrorists.' She went on to say very clearly: 'I wouldn't support killing civilians in any way, so I was against what happened on 7 October.' This is a real human being with real family here.</span>

This side of the parliament does. That's why it's the No. 1 focus of this side of the House. It's why we are rolling out tax cuts for every taxpayer, energy bill relief for every household, cheaper medicines, cheaper early childhood education, better pay and more rent assistance. This is why the ABS says that inflation would be higher were it not for the cost-of-living help that we put in the budget.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That cost-of-living help is a key part in the fight against inflation but not the only part. We've also turned two big Liberal deficits into two big Labor surpluses. We have made the coming deficit smaller than we inherited from the incompetents over there. Our responsible economic management is particularly important when our economy is soft and there's a lot of uncertainty in the global economy. Weakness in the Chinese economy and the big fall we've seen in iron ore prices are another reminder that we aren't immune from global economic volatility. That's why we take such a cautious and conservative approach to resource prices and revenue when we're putting our budgets together, and it's why we bank much more of any upside than our opponents used to do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Government spending is obviously not the primary determinant of prices in our economy, but our responsible economic management is helping, not hampering, the fight against inflation. In this regard, Governor Bullock made three very important points about governments and about working together with the Reserve Bank. The first point she made was that the government and the Reserve Bank are completely aligned. The second point, which she has made in the last few weeks and months, is that our surpluses are helping the fight against inflation. The third point she made is that public spending is not the main game when it comes to inflation. The governor's testimony on Friday completely obliterated all the dishonesty we hear from those opposite, repeated by others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the same people who left us with inflation much higher, and rising, and a budget full of waste and rorts and much bigger deficits. Now they want higher inflation and higher interest rates and lower wages and less help for people, because they hope nobody will notice that we're into the third year of a three-year term and they don't have any credible or costed economic policies. They don't want anyone to notice that what they've said about nuclear, about housing and about supermarkets will push prices up, not down, and make things worse. And they don't want to come clean on their $315 billion of cuts and what those cuts would mean for Medicare, for pensions and for our economy more broadly. We are providing cost-of-living help that they don't support, surpluses that they could not deliver and responsible economic management that they wouldn't know the first thing about and that they couldn't be bothered asking about.</span>

The Senate inquiry into Darwin's Middle Arm project heard from the Northern Territory's chief minister that a petrochemical factory could be established there. And the gas company Tamboran has told the ASX that they have exclusive rights to build a gas export terminal at Middle Arm, with gas fracked out of the Beetaloo basin. In light of this, will your government now withdraw its $1½ billion fossil fuel subsidy for the Middle Arm project? Or is fracking the NT part of the Albanese government's Future Made in Australia?</span>

I also note that the Senate inquiry is yet to report on the Middle Arm project, so thank you for pre-empting that. Can I say very clearly that Darwin in particular is one of the few capital cities that does not have a significant industrial precinct. The Northern Territory government is seeking to secure its economic future. The Northern Territory is heavily reliant on funding—in fact, I think almost 80 per cent of its funding for schools, hospitals, for roads—because it cannot generate income in its own right. So, Middle Arm is about trying to provide that opportunity. And we have industrial precincts. We have huge ones in Melbourne, in my home state. Every capital city has those. So, Middle Arm is about trying to take the advantage of the energy future that is needed for this country and to bring that advantage into the Northern Territory and provide the people of the Northern Territory with new jobs and an economic revenue stream that allows them to fund hospitals, schools and services for First Nations peoples.</span>

He knows, as everyone on this side of the House does, that a secure, well-paying job is crucial in confronting cost-of-living pressures and that a country that makes things also makes secure, well-paying jobs. There was a bit of good news in last week's average weekly earnings figures, showing manufacturing workers doing better since we took office. Average manufacturing worker pay has gone up by 14 per cent, from around $76,000 to about $87,000. On top of that, with our cost-of-living tax cuts, manufacturing workers will take an extra $1,900 along with those wage increases, earning more and keeping more of what they earn. Nine hundred thousand manufacturing workers know that the Albanese government has got their backs, because we back Australian manufacturing and that's exactly what the Future Made in Australia Bill aims to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, our commitment to manufacturing is solid. On the other side they only ever talk about manufacturing to talk it down. Their track record is appalling; they saw off 100,000 manufacturing jobs. They had a former defence minister, in David Johnston, say of the ASC he wouldn't trust them to build a canoe. What a slap in the face for Australian defence manufacturing. They had a treasurer at this very dispatch box, Joe Hockey, goad Australian car manufacturers offshore. And they've got another New South Wales Liberal in the form of Andrew Constance, who wants to join that mob in this place. Look at his track record. You might remember he is the person who quits one seat, says he'll run for another, then says he won't before deciding to run for another seat—great conviction politician! He too doesn't back Australian manufacturing, saying we don't have it and there's a reason for it. And he's absolutely right: it is their lack of conviction, industry policy written on a white flag. He was the guy who sent bus manufacturing offshore, train manufacturing offshore and ferry manufacturing offshore. The only problem was that, when the trains and the ferries came back, they wouldn't fit on the tracks and they kind of didn't fit under bridges. No problem with that!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That colossus of conviction wants to join with another one: the shadow Treasurer, whose heartwarming log cabin story of being a manufacturing worker for decades—I've got to say I love that one. He boldly claimed that the coalition always supported manufacturing. He said that right there on the floor of the House and then turned up at the ABC studios to say, 'You can't build things competitively in this country.' So he says they back manufacturing here and then goes down there and says that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've always said, their heart's not in it. They don't believe in Australian manufacturing except for a photo op. Australian manufacturing workers deserve better. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Not only is she a great advocate for her electorate but she knows how important it is to support local councils to deliver priority projects across her electorate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, we value the work that our councils are doing and we know how important it is to deliver funds to help them do their work. It's why we are progressively doubling Roads to Recovery, and in the member for Gilmore's electorate that will mean an extra $13.3 million over the next five years, bringing her total Roads to Recovery budget for councils to $30.8 million. It's a program that automatically goes out to councils every year, with no need for a colour coded spreadsheet.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local government is in every town, every village and every city across the country. When those opposite had the ability to help local councils, did they? No. They froze indexation on financial assistance grants, which has led to a funding shortfall across the country. As for the 440 local people who wanted to run for council, did the New South Wales Liberal Party support them? No. Only 281 of those candidates are actually going to be nominated. Many of those people had already started campaigning. John Dorahy, a Wollongong mayoral hopeful, shared his disappointment that his party couldn't get a form in on time. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But wait; there's more, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Utopia</span> could not have scripted this—the irony of the New South Wales Liberals demanding that the Electoral Commission adhere to a deadline imposed by them when they couldn't adhere to a deadline that's been posted on a publicly available website for close to a year. 'But hey! Let us have a crack at building and running nuclear energy power plants!' Yeah-nah.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current New South Wales opposition leader, Mark Speakman, said, 'It's a basic matter of competence and administration.' In fact, it is incompetence and maladministration, but it is hardly surprising from a group of people who look to blame other people all the time. This is the party that gave us robodebt. It gave us multiple ministries. It gave us doctored paperwork rolled out by the member for Hume, purporting to be from a council. And who can forget, 'I don't hold a hose, mate'?</span>

On Thursday in Washington, President Biden completed the last step in the establishment of a licence-free defence export zone between America, the United Kingdom and Australia, and this is the achievement of a generational dream.</span>

This will also make it much easier for technology to flow from America to Australia, which is so critical for Australia's building of our future submarines, but which is also important in other areas like guided weapons and explosive ordnance enterprise. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lockheed Martin will begin the manufacture of guided land based rockets in Australia from next year, and this is a direct result of the work that we've been doing with the United States, along with a more than $16 billion investment over the next decade. There is such a contrast between what this government is doing and the smoke and mirrors that we were so used to from those opposite, because the Liberals only allocated $1 billion towards GWEO, which meant that there was no realistic prospect of seeing the manufacture of guided weapons in this country for more than a decade. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to matching Labor's increased defence spending, the shadow minister for defence is desperately clinging on to a text that he's received from his beloved leader. But as to his text to the shadow treasurer, there he is definitely being left on red because the shadow treasurer has made abundantly clear that coalition defence spending will stay within the envelope which they took to the last election. That means that there is a $50 billion difference between what's in Labor's budgets and what's on the coalition's books. That means that the Liberals are now dangerously close to the kind of failure that, to quote the shadow minister, would be 'leaving Australia's defences so weak that we provoke aggression'. On this side of the House we're making concrete decisions to improve our nation's defences so we that can keep Australian safe.</span>

The first is that the security standard which our security intelligence agencies apply to everyone coming to Australia doesn't stop when they're on their way here. It's ongoing, as the Leader of the Opposition would full well know. If anyone who comes to our country is assessed to be a threat at any time to our national security, then intervention occurs and their visa gets cancelled. If anyone who comes to our country undermines our laws, they get dealt with by our law enforcement. We trust our security agencies and law enforcement to do their jobs. I'll make this point as well—well, two further ones. In the financial year that the conflict began, after Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine, the previous government issued—</span>

Some of those might have been before or after that conflict began, but that's the figure for the financial year. I make this point too: during their entire time in office, the former government issued more than 1,000 visitor visas to Palestinians from the Occupied Palestinian Territories.</span>

                  </a>  I'll take the interjection. Apparently, this Leader of the Opposition thinks that Hamas became bad on October 7 and that before then they were okay—it was all hunky-dory. Well, Hamas have been the enemy not just of Israel but of the Palestinian people as well. The hypocrisy is just extraordinary. When the Leader of the Opposition challenged Malcolm Turnbull, he said this, 'It's good to be in front of the cameras where I can smile and maybe show a different side to what I show when I talk about border protection.' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Last week I referred to the three o'clock deadline that was coming. I made sure I got the question in before three o'clock because I presumed there was some chance, by the time we got there, there that the opposition might not vote to protect John Setka and the CFMEU. But after three o'clock came, the senators, controlled by the Leader of the Opposition, all lined up and voted with the Greens to make sure that at least another week was given to the current leadership of the CFMEU. They haven't even committed to making a decision this week. Is it another week? Is it another month? How long are they willing to do it?</span>

The city's north-west metro has opened today, yet in the fastest-growing areas of Sydney's south-west, with the highest disadvantaged population and a new airport, people are paying more tolls for travel and more taxes on fuel levy, have poor rail connectivity and are sitting on freeways that are looking more like large car parking lots. When will the government commit to building the much-needed east-west metro, which will service and connect the people of Western Sydney to jobs and growth opportunities?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:44</span>):  I thank the member for Fowler for her question. I acknowledge the 62,000 taxpayers in her electorate who received a tax cut on 1 July and the 61,000 households receiving energy relief. We, of course, on this side of the House know how important Western Sydney is, not just for New South Wales but for the prosperity of our entire nation. As the Prime Minister has said before, Western Sydney is changing. It is changing dramatically, and it's changing dramatically as a result of the investments that are being made to really turn Sydney to the west. It used to focus on the east when it's looking for jobs, and now a lot of the jobs are coming from the west. It's a powerhouse of the New South Wales economy and the economy of the entire nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's why in the budget we committed nearly $2 billion for infrastructure specifically in Western Sydney. It's why overall we're spending $17.3 billion. We're building the airport. It's over 80 per cent complete. I was there just recently with the topping out of the terminal, which is looking terrific, and we'll have more to say about the airport shortly. We're also investing in the metro—close train stations not just to connect the airport but also to connect those important economic zones. We've also invested in the road infrastructure to connect the airports to other parts of Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, the other projects that we've invested in are $5.2 billion, as I said, for Sydney Metro; $500 million for Mamre Road stage 2; $400 million for Elizabeth Drive; $260 million, obviously matched by the New South Wales government, for Richmond Road; $286 million to upgrade Mulgoa Road stages 1 and 2; $570 million for the Moorebank intermodal project, which is taking the equivalent of 3,000 heavy vehicles off Sydney roads; $128 million for Dunheved Road in Penrith; $190 million to upgrade the Moorebank Avenue and Hume Highway intersections; $100 million for Western Sydney rapid bus infrastructure upgrades; and $95 million to Horsley Drive. We are absolutely committed to making sure that Western Sydney is the powerhouse not just of New South Wales but of the whole of the nation's economy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:47</span>):  Thank you to the member for Lyons, who is such a terrific advocate for better health care, particularly in rural and regional Australia. A few months ago, he joined the Prime Minister and me and many others besides to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Medicare. For Labor and for Australians who'd come to cherish our most important social program, it was indeed a celebration. Medicare has delivered this country one of the best healthcare systems on the planet. It's ranked No. 1 for health outcomes and, importantly for Labor, No. 1 for health equity as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's notable there's been no celebration on the other side, not a single murmur, because they never wanted Medicare to survive for 40 years, let alone to thrive. We remember John Howard describing Medicare—get this—as one of the great failures of the Hawke government. That's what the godfather of the modern Liberal Party said. Even after they finally accepted that the Australian people would simply not accept them abolishing Medicare, they've never stopped trying to dismantle and weaken the program year after year, like the Leader of the Opposition freezing the Medicare rebate or trying to rip $50 billion out of our public hospitals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's bulk-billing that's always really offended them. John Howard called it an absolute rort. The Leader of the Opposition said that there were too many free Medicare services before he tried to abolish bulk-billing altogether. But, for Labor, bulk-billing is the beating heart of the Medicare program. That is why last year we tripled the bulk-billing incentive. Since that record investment in November, we've seen bulk-billing for GP visits rise in every single state and every single territory. The member for Lyons will be very pleased that the biggest increase of all has been in the state of Tasmania, where bulk-billing is up by more than seven per cent. Across the nation in just eight months there have been more than three million additional free visits to the doctor. In June there were more than 900,000 additional free visits to the doctor, the same number in May—just one month alone—making a real difference to millions of Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Medicare is still under very real pressure and we know there's a lot more for us to do to keep strengthening Medicare, but we also know that all of that progress on urgent care clinics, on bulk-billing and on making medicines cheaper is under real threat by those opposite. The shadow Treasurer confirmed again last week that he doesn't support any of that additional investment. All of that investment in bulk-billing will go and the urgent clinics will close. As for the Leader of the Opposition, you just need to look at his record.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:51</span>):  I want to thank my friend, the fantastic member for Higgins, for her question. We're wiping $3 billion of student debt for more than three million Australians, including more than 26,000 people in the member for Higgins' electorate. That legislation is in the parliament right now and it will be debated this week. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For someone with an average HECS debt of about $26,000 it means their debt will be reduced by about $1,200. For someone with a HECS debt of, say, $45,000, it will cut their debt by about $2,000. When the legislation passes, the ATO will automatically apply this to your student loan. And if you've paid off your loan since the first of June last year, you will get a tax credit. It's an important part of making HECS fairer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not the only thing this legislation does. It also provides financial support for teaching students, nursing students, midwifery students and social work students while they do their practical training. It also massively expands those fee-free courses that are like a bridging course between school and university to give you those foundational skills you need to start a university degree. It's all part of building a better and a fairer education system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, the number of students finishing high school jumped from 40 per cent to almost 80 per cent, and that was nation-changing stuff. Now we need to take the next step. That's why we've set ourselves a target as a country that by the middle of this century it won't be just 80 per cent of young people that have finished school but 80 per cent that have got a TAFE qualification or a university degree as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To do that we've got to break down that invisible barrier that stops a lot of young people from the bush, the regions and the outer suburbs from getting a crack at university in the first place. That requires big changes to our universities, and it also requires us to fix the funding of public schools and tie that to practical reforms like catch-up tutoring. That's why I was pleased yesterday to see the Leader of the Nationals back the action that the government wants to take on this on television, proving once again that he is the driving force on policy in the opposition and I welcome his support for our reforms to school education. I genuinely do. I know that he gets it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope the Leader of the Nationals will support the changes we're making to wipe more than $3 billion in student debt; to provide financial support for teaching students, nursing students, social work students and midwifery students; and to help to make sure that more kids from the bush and from the suburbs get a crack at university. Hopefully, just like everything else, he can persuade the Liberal Party to support it as well. </span>

The Multicultural Framework Review is a generational reform agenda requiring a whole-of-government and community approach that will position Australia realise its full potential as a nation made up of many cultures, faiths and lived experiences. We often rightly call out antisemitism and Islamophobia, but too rarely racism—and, especially, racist policy. The review called on the government and all citizens to actively combat racism, which is still experienced by far too many. How will you ensure policies do not prejudice and lead to vilification of minority groups?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DYW" type="MemberAnswer">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Arts, Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Cyber Security, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:55</span>):  I thank the member for Warringah for the question. The Multicultural Framework Review is an important document that follows a long period of consultation—and I pay tribute to the Minister for Skills for all the work that he did in making sure we have that available for Australia. It starts with a simple view that we are better together—that's the simplicity of it. The fact that we need, quite properly, to have rules around making sure that everybody is safe does not disqualify us from also making sure people feel welcome. We have a series of issues. One is the messages that the government sends—simply having the Multicultural Framework Review at all is an important thing. Secondly, some of the funding measures that have been decided on that flow from that and give some of the emerging communities in particular a better capacity is important work as well. Effectively, you end up with three sorts of events: some events where people get to celebrate their heritage; other events where it's one big celebration and we all celebrate it together; and other opportunities to learn from each other and to understand each other's stories. You need to thread through all of those.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's another part of it. We've spoken about the way we talk—and you have referred to racism—very much in the context of the recommendations of the Director-General of Security at ASIO. That's important. It's also a conversation that really did begin long before that. If there is one thing I hope we have now resolved, I hope we have put away the arguments that we had to deal with for nine long years of being told that we needed to lower our protections against racial hate speech. Those comments were made by some people who are now very senior critics. It was the Leader of the Opposition who wanted those protections lowered, and said the Australian people 'don't want to have … officials out of Canberra jamming some sort of language code down their throat'. That was the response to hate speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Paterson said, 'If it was up to me we'd put an 18C repeal bill every day of the week until it passes.' The now shadow minister for Defence said, 'That's why we have defamation law, we don't need 18C to sort these issues out.' I put to those who are in a similar position to me and to the member for Warringah: neither the member nor I will experience racism at any point in our lives in Australia, but our neighbours will and our friends will, and words can be bullets. While it might seem like a great way for some people to get a headline, none of us should underestimate the harm it does not just to those individuals but to the fabric of the nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:59</span>):  I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. She is an incredible advocate for her local community and we are very lucky to have her representing the eastern and south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a housing crisis in our country which is affecting the lives of millions of Australians. It's renters who are copping too many rent increases that are too high. It's that experience of being a renter where people aren't getting the security they need, especially if they have children and pets. It's that sense that home ownership is slipping away for a generation of young people who deserve so much better from their country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a decade the Commonwealth stepped back and basically refused to engage in the housing issue in our country. We are taking a different approach. Today our country is led by a Prime Minister whose entire life trajectory was reshaped by the access he got in his childhood to safe and affordable housing. So, of course, under the Albanese government, we are backing the housing game. In the two years since we were elected, we have invested $32 billion in this critical national challenge. I want to give you a sense of the profound difference in energy and focus that housing is getting under our government. Our government invested more in housing in our last budget than was spent in the entire nine years that the coalition were in power. I really want people to hear this: we spent more in one budget than was spent in the entire nine years that the coalition governed this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the big picture, the answer to Australia's housing problems is that we need to build more homes in our country. So the Prime Minister has sat down with the states and said, 'We need a bold and ambitious goal of building 1.2 million homes across our country over the coming five years.' But we also recognise, of course, that people need help now. That's why you've seen our government execute on these two back-to-back increases to Commonwealth rent assistance. That's the first time this has happened in 30 years. I also want to point to the support the government has offered to first home buyers. Under our government 110,000 first home buyers have been helped into the market through the Home Guarantee Scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot build the kind of response to this crisis that's needed without a new kind of partnership with states and territories. Next week I'm doing something that didn't happen for the last five years that the coalition were in power, and that is bringing together the state housing ministers. We're going to sit down together in Western Sydney and work out how we can turbocharge our response to this crisis. This is an incredibly dynamic group of ministers.</span>

He cares deeply about the pressures that his constituents are under, and he represents them really ably in this place. This is another question time where those opposite have completely vacated the field on inflation and the economy. The shadow Treasurer sits there, and they won't even give him a turn on the dog whistle. Everyone else gets a turn on the dog whistle except for the shadow Treasurer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House care about the cost of living, even if those opposite don't. We know that people are doing it tough, and that's why we are doing something about it: tax cuts for every taxpayer; energy bill relief for every household; help with medicines, rent and early childhood education; and a pay rise for people who need it. This goes to the biggest difference between that side of the House and this side of the House. We're trying to help people with the cost of living; they're trying to divide and diminish people. They care more about starting culture wars than finishing the fight against inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the most divisive opposition leader that we have seen, and that should disqualify him from the prime ministership of a great country like ours. He has decades of form when it comes to divisive rhetoric which divides our community and makes Australians less safe, not more safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone in here and out there should understand his strategy. Let's be very clear: these culture wars are all designed to distract from the fact that he has no economic credibility whatsoever. He thinks that, if he starts a culture war and divides our community, nobody will notice that we're in the third year of a three-year parliamentary term and he still has no credible or costed economic policies whatsoever. He hopes that nobody will notice that they haven't come clean on where the $315 billion in cuts are going to come from, what it means for Medicare, what it means for pensions or what it means for the economy more broadly. He hopes that, if he starts a culture war, nobody will notice that the shadow Treasurer just isn't up to it. That's not just a view held on this side of the House, let me tell you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are all about dividing the nation, not fighting inflation. They are long on conflict and they are short on credibility. They don't understand that you don't dial down the pressures that people are feeling by dialling up division in our local communities. You fight inflation with cost-of-living relief, with a couple of surpluses and with responsible economic management. That's our focus, even if it's not theirs.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281988" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBAIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  That was an interesting contribution from the member for Dawson. If only he had been part of a government, for nine years, that didn't want manufacturers to leave the country, didn't refer to manufacturing in Australia as a 'graveyard' and didn't make sure things were made offshore when they could have been made onshore. That is in contrast to what we want to do. The Albanese Labor government has a plan for a future made right here in Australia, and it's very simple. It says: 'We need to make more things in our own backyard. We want our communities to benefit from that hard work. We want people to reap the rewards of making those things here.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Making more things in our country will help grow our economy. It will create good jobs, particularly in our rural and regional communities—jobs at home, because you shouldn't have to pack your bags to build a career. Australia has everything we need right here in this country to build our future, and Labor recognises that much of this is in our regions. We've got world-leading industries, world-class resources and some of the best innovators in the world. The Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 is all about seizing the opportunities that come with this. It is about securing our place in a global economic and strategic landscape that's quickly changing. One thing COVID reminded us was that we need to do things for ourselves. We need to build more things right at home, here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade of coalition neglect and deliberate underinvestment, the Albanese government isn't wasting a day. We're delivering the infrastructure, the skills, the jobs and the services that will boost liveability and ensure that our regional communities are strengthened. That's because Labor governments have a strong record of boosting local manufacturing and making our regions more productive. This is something we're building on with our $22.7 billion Future Made in Australia plan and through our investments in the 2024-25 budget. We're putting regional industries and economies at the centre of our plan by leveraging the competitive advantages outside of our big cities, from vast energy resources, advantages in new clean energy industries, an agricultural sector that is world leading, and innovation that we're committed to harnessing. Our record investments across the two budgets are making this potential a reality. We're stimulating regional economies and we're unlocking significant investment opportunities. This will forge a better future in our regions, supporting locally led organisations to grow and ensuring that people continue to develop new skills close to home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this, our $1.7 billion Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund will uplift priority sectors, many of which are based in our regions. We know Australia has significant potential to become one of the lowest-cost producers of green metals. Our iron, steel, alumina and aluminium sectors are already providing employment for 39,000 Australian. These sectors are supporting local construction, defence, transport and infrastructure projects, as well as our export markets. Having recently driven past BlueScope Steel at Port Kembla, to me it's clear how big this industry is and how it underpins local economies. Our investments are all about leveraging existing expertise and unlocking the forward capability we know is there. We will also invest $8 billion over the next decade to put Australia on a path to being a global player in hydrogen. This will forge a new skilled workforce in our regional communities and ensure we can take advantage of growing Indo-Pacific markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the world progresses towards its net-zero commitments, we know there will be an increased demand on minerals needed for renewable energy technologies, from hydrogen to batteries and solar panels. We're already the world's largest producer of lithium, and we're ensuring that we continue to strengthen the resilience in our supply chains. This includes $7 billion towards our critical minerals production tax incentives, which is showing Australia and the world that we're serious about investing in value-adding production. That's on top of our $566.1 million investment to support Geoscience Australia to progressively map the whole of onshore Australia by 2060. Having a comprehensive picture of our critical minerals, alternative energy sources, groundwater and other resources will ensure that we can leverage the opportunities that come with a net-zero future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our $835.6 million investment to grow Australian solar manufacturing and our $549 million investment to boost domestic battery-manufacturing capabilities will have significant benefits for our regions. We know that Australians invented solar panels, yet we didn't commercialise the technology and keep it onshore. We want to make sure we don't make that mistake again. Under Labor, we're generating 25 per cent more renewable energy, and we've ticked off enough renewable energy projects to power three million homes. At Punchs Creek in the Toowoomba region, an 800-megawatt solar farm will support up to 340 direct jobs during construction and generate enough energy to power 300,000 homes. Projects like this will continue to roll out across our regions, because this is what happens when you throw away a colour coded spreadsheet and invest with purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Future Made in Australia is all about building on all of the great work we're doing now and making sure companies have what they need to unlock a pipeline of new opportunities. As the member for Eden-Monaro, I only have to look around at my vast electorate to see firsthand what investing in Australian-made looks like—amazing examples of companies coming together, like the Bega Group coming together with a whole range of local agricultural suppliers to build a circular economy in our valley. Their great work will now see the national Centre for Circularity built in Bega, and many local producers and local companies are now taking advantage of what working with a conglomerate like Bega Cheese and the Bega Group is, along with Deloitte, KPMG and Rabobank. This is an innovative project. If anyone wants to have a look at it, check out <span style="font-style:italic;">Landline</span> on ABC iview for the amazing vision of Barry Irvin, the chairman of Bega Cheese.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are the sunniest, windiest continent on earth and should be world leaders on the next generation of renewable energy sources. In 2022, 32 per cent of Australia's total electricity generation was from renewable energy sources. We've got a bold agenda, net zero by 2050, which is why we're putting the planning behind us and not wasting a day. Regional Australia will benefit from this, with new jobs, new industries and new skills. But we need a government prepared to step up and also do its part, and that's why we're investing $22.7 billion in this bold and innovative plan—a plan that goes hand-in-hand with our record investments in regional skills and training, including fee-free TAFE. We want kids sitting at Bega High School or Tumut High School right now to know that there's a future for them right there in their back yard if that's what they choose, and we want to send the strongest possible message that we're a government committed to strengthening regional economies by making more things here.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282306" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  I've said time and time again in this place that I live in the best region in the best state in the best country in the world. I tell my constituents that every day. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmanians are innovators and in the North West, the West Coast and King Island, it's full of them. It's that island ingenuity. We manufacture high quality, world-leading products in my electorate. We are the home of Elphinstone, Delta Hydraulics, Penguin Composites, Jayben, Direct Edge and many others, which are all playing a part in transforming our region into a manufacturing centre of excellence. So when this government speaks of a future made in Australia, I'm excited because in my mind I translate that into a future made in Tasmania for me and my electorate. I know there's an enormous opportunity for our state to continue to leverage off our natural advantages and our world-leading business owners. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's a vast difference between my vision for our future and the ongoing prosperity for the manufacturers and this bill. This is another typical Labor bill. It's about the silky smooth sales pitch rather than fixing the real barriers that are stifling our workplaces and stifling industry. Not surprisingly, it's a Labor bill that is centred around the notion that governments know best. It's interventionist. It has the Prime Minister and his team trying to be everything to everyone, having a bit each way. There's a tag for you. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a bill where there's an attempt to solve a raft of problems of their own making, but all they are doing is creating multiple problems in a misguided effort to find a solution. There's nothing more dangerous for business and our future than a government who think they know best. A government who refuse to listen to industry experts and leading economists who are all telling them that this bill is fundamentally flawed. Of course, we all want more things made in Australia. The global financial crisis, the epidemic and ongoing geopolitical tensions across the world have reminded us of our vulnerability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the world is changing rapidly, and in this readjustment Australia must secure its position. We must act to remain globally competitive in industries where we have a comparative advantage. We must be clear eyed about what the government's role and what industry's role are in achieving this. That's what's at the heart of this bill and that's what this debate is about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What exactly is the Albanese government trying to achieve? It's trying to get the fundamentals of the economy right, as we would expect, and rightly so. For example, this government is trying to play a role in providing affordable and reliable energy. But ask yourself, have they kept their election commitment to businesses and industry to make energy cheaper under this government? Of course they haven't. The facts back this in. Local manufacturers are suffering under this government's energy crisis. Labor promised a reduction in energy costs for businesses but they've only seen and delivered an increase.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what is this bill delivering? On the face of it, it appears to be a return to the interventionist and protectionist Labor of old. I've said more than once in this place that governments do not create wealth. It's our thriving business sector that creates wealth. When it comes to energy costs, my electorate is also an agricultural based electorate and energy plays a big part in that as we export products all over the world and our domestic market. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We forget sometimes in this place that energy plays a part and comes in different forms. It's not just energy that comes out of the power socket. Electricity is obviously the first thing we think of, but diesel and fuel are forms of energy, and fertiliser is a type of energy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We import a lot of canola into Tasmania for our dairy industry. We are the epicentre of the dairy industry in the great state of Tasmania. There is a dairy in my electorate that milks 23,000 milking cows twice a day, so they import a lot of canola and a lot of protein into the state of Tasmania. Well, we measure that in metabolic energy units, or ME, so that is effectively energy. That plays a part. Obviously that energy is carted on ships and on trucks, and that uses diesel and fossil fuels to transport that product to market and to farm, so that is affected. Everywhere that touches, energy is involved in some form or another. SeaRoad, operating out of the Devonport port in my electorate, operates a 214-metre long vessel which transports containers and freight from the state of Tasmania to Melbourne. That vessel has a combination of a compression-ignition internal combustion engine and a diesel engine which has LNG injection on board to make that more effective and more friendly to the environment. So again energy is used. There are farmers in my electorate—and I know this from my own operation—that have used diesel pumps for their irrigation over the last couple of years because it's effectively cheaper than running it from electricity, and that's not good enough. So energy plays a big part. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's government's responsibility to put into place the policy settings that are necessary to achieve the step away from this energy dependence and let businesses do what they know best. It's not government's job to pick winners. It's not government's job to invest taxpayer money or to prop up uncompetitive businesses in the hope that sometime in the future they might be able to hold their own on the international commodity market. This approach, government providing industry subsidies to business, has failed right around the world time and time again. But intervention and providing taxpayer subsidies in an attempt to make a company internationally competitive is Labor's approach to this bill, and Labor has been warned by industry and by leading economists that this approach will fail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take an example. Let's take Labor's push for local manufacturing of solar panels. Under this plan, we would pour taxpayers' money into businesses to get them up off the ground. We would hold their hand and prop them up for an unspecified time with taxpayers' money, but at some stage we have to let them go on the international commodity market, where they are competing with the likes of China. China produces currently more than 90 per cent of the global supply of solar panels. Anyone who thinks that's a small thing to ask—that any Aussie manufacturer is going to be able to compete with the economies of scale, the cheap labour and the Chinese government backed solar panels industry and come out on top—is delusional. And what next? When the industry fails, as it inevitably will do, do we go back to the government, cap in hand, and ask for some more money? What happens to the workers? What happens to the local communities? What happens to their suppliers? And, when it comes to households buying solar panels, do we de-incentivise imported solar panels and force consumers to buy Australian-made? How do we do that, and are we going to put a tariff on imported goods? Where does it stop? Where does the intervention stop? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Productivity Commission Chair Danielle Wood is just one of the many who are voicing concerns about the high risks associated with this proposal around this bill. She warns against investing in industries like solar panels that don't have a competitive advantage. She says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It diverts resources, that's workers and capital, away from other parts of the economy where they might generate high value uses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's important because individual sectors within our economy don't work in isolation. If you give it to one, you're taking it from another. If you give a leg-up to one industry, you are stifling another. It is a finely tuned ecosystem, easily disrupted, and the greatest disruptor of all seems to be government. Ms Wood went on to say that this bill risks entrenching subsidy-dependent industries and would come at a cost to the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, this is a well-worn path for this government. This underperforming government is under pressure to deliver something in this term. Their popularity is waning, and they have no capacity to solve the challenges before them. So what do they do? They're going to cash-splash. It's a well-worn path taken by Labor MPs in a similar situation. We'll never forget the tragedy of the Rudd government's $2.8 billion home insulation scheme—a scheme that resulted in a royal commission where government was held to account for a policy that was made on the run and, as a result, was not properly designed or implemented. And then there were the rorts and the waste of the $3½ billion Building the Education Revolution fund. That's where this policy is heading. This government is running out of time, and in response it has put this bill forward trying to be all things to all people. It's policy on the run, and we all know that will end up down south.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what the Prime Minister has said about the Future Made in Australia Bill:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Future Made in Australia plan is about attracting and enabling investment, making Australia a renewable energy superpower, value-adding to our resources and strengthening economic security, backing Australian ideas and investing in the people, communities and services that will drive our national success.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And yet, over the past two years, day after day, year after year, the Prime Minister and his government have stood by and done nothing as the rising cost of doing business is sending businesses to the wall. They're closing their doors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is saying that it wants to pick winners while watching businesses that have thrived for decades go broke. They've been so focused on this unnecessary bill that they have actually turned their backs on the sector that they say that they are trying to support. It doesn't make sense. Energy costs, taxation, IR legislation, red tape, green tape, insurance, transport—the list goes on. Around 19,000 businesses have entered insolvency since Labor came to office—19,000. It's the highest on record since ASIC began collecting data. It's beyond belief that this government is talking about a future made in Australia when right now, today, at this minute, they're sending businesses to the wall. It doesn't make sense. This is a government whose ego is so big that it has stopped listening to communities and the business sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our region is the engine room of our state's economy. When I was elected in 2019, I pledged to fight every day to ensure that we received our fair share, and the former government listened. During my first term, Braddon received the second-highest investment of any electorate in Australia. That's something I'll never shy away from. It's only right. It's right for my region and my businesses. We invested in key infrastructure projects. We backed our local manufacturers. We gave them business confidence. We gave them an over-the-horizon strategic vision. This investment continues to be rolled out, and it's building the infrastructure of the future. That's what we need. This, in turn, is supporting small businesses, who employ thousands of locals in my region. It's keeping money in our local communities, and it's keeping money in local families' pockets, and they spend it in local shops.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But under this Albanese government principle, this bill, the pipeline of projects has dried up. Labor has no strategic vision for our future. The best that they can come up with, this bill, is an on-the-run move to pit one industry against another. We'll throw a splash of environmental considerations in on that, which will only exacerbate the damage. This is a government that is desperately seeking solutions. The foundation is all based on the wrong priorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And this is what has resulted in this bad bill. It is a bill that will only insert government. It is a bill that will result in billions of dollars of waste when it comes to taxpayers' money. This is a bill that has failed to gain any support from mainstream economists and industry itself. Australians want and deserve better. Only the coalition understands our national strengths. We are looking to build a nation which is a mining and manufacturing and agricultural powerhouse and a leader in technology and innovation. As a consequence, I cannot support this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:34</span>):  The Albanese Labor government is determined to see Australia become a nation that makes more things here, a nation that creates jobs and opportunities for all and a nation that stands strong in the face of global economic challenges. It's what brings the members of this government to Canberra. It's what brings an illustrious intellect such as the member for Parramatta to the floor of this parliament to sit by my side as I attentively absorb his contribution. For too long we have seen industries and jobs leave our shores, weakening our economic base and leaving Australians vulnerable. The Albanese Labor government is committed to reversing that trend. We are investing in Australian manufacturing, technology and innovation, ensuring that our economy is resilient, diverse and future focused.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Made in Australia plan is about building an economy that works for everyone. It's about making sure that every Australian has the opportunity to benefit from our collective growth and prosperity. We have the opportunity to build a nation that doesn't just survive but excels in a competitive global economy. For too long our economy has relied heavily on exporting raw materials and importing finished goods. This has left us vulnerable to global market fluctuations and has meant that many of the high-paying jobs associated with these industries have gone offshore. The Albanese Labor government is determined to turn this around. The Future Made in Australia plan is about reclaiming our position as a country that not only provides raw materials but also produces high-quality products. It's about strengthening our industrial base, supporting local businesses and ensuring that Australia is more self-reliant and economically secure in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're making targeted investments in areas where Australia has a natural advantage, whether it's in manufacturing, critical materials or technology sectors. We believe in building a diverse and robust economy that can withstand the challenges of tomorrow. This is a vision for a prosperous and independent Australia that makes more things here and creates opportunities all across our great nation. A resilient economy is one that is built on diversity, innovation and self-reliance. By expanding our industrial base and reducing our dependency on international supply chains, we're not only strengthening our economy but also safeguarding it against global uncertainties. The Future Made in Australia plan will see significant investment in industries such as advanced manufacturing and minerals processing. These are sectors that have the potential to create thousands of good, high-paying jobs and position Australia is a global leader in innovation and production.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For our national interest framework, we're aligning economic incentives with the national interest. This ensures that the benefits of public investments flow back into communities, creating local jobs and opportunities. We're not just talking about creating jobs; we're talking about creating secure, well-paid jobs that offer skills development and stability for Australian workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia was once known for its strong manufacturing sector, but, over the years, we've seen a decline as production moved offshore. It's time now to reverse this trend. The Future Made in Australia plan is focused on bringing manufacturing back to our shores, creating jobs, boosting innovation and supporting Australian businesses. Our vision includes making Australia a leader in advanced manufacturing where we can produce the high-tech goods that the entire world's economy is demanding. Whether it's in electronics, medical devices or machinery, Australian manufacturers have the skills and expertise to compete globally. We're providing the support they need to grow and thrive, from access to capital and cutting-edge research to workforce development and infrastructure investment. By investing in our manufacturing capabilities, we're ensuring that Australia can produce the goods we need domestically, reducing reliance on imports and creating a stronger, more self-sufficient economy. This is about making sure that Australians benefit from the jobs and economic growth that come from a revitalised manufacturing sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A future made in Australia requires a workforce that is ready for the challenges of tomorrow. That's why we're investing in skills and training programs that will equip Australians with the knowledge and expertise they need to thrive in a changing economy. From advanced manufacturing to new technologies, the jobs of the future will require new skills. We're working with educational institutions, industry and unions to ensure that our training programs are aligned with the needs of our economy. This is about giving Australians the tools they need to succeed and ensuring that no-one is left behind as our economy evolves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also focused on making education and training more accessible. By investing in local training facilities and programs, we're ensuring that all Australians have the opportunity to develop the skills they need, no matter where they live. This is how we will build a more inclusive and equitable economy—one that benefits all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of the Future Made in Australia plan is a commitment to our people. We understand that a thriving economy must be one that benefits everyone, not just the select few. That's why our plan is focused on creating opportunities for every Australian, no matter where they live or what their background might be. This means investing in local communities all across our country, ensuring that they have the infrastructure, the skills training and the support that is needed to participate in and benefit from our nation's growth. It means supporting local businesses and ensuring that they can access the markets and opportunities that they need to succeed. It means making sure that the jobs we create are secure, are well-paid and offer real career development opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our commitment to communities also extends to ensuring that the economic benefits of this plan are shared fairly. We've established community benefit principles that guide our investments, ensuring that they create strong returns for local communities, local workers and local businesses. We're promoting safe and secure jobs, developing skilled and inclusive workforces, and engaging positively with local communities for gross economic benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is home to some of the brightest minds in the world. I'm sure the member for Parramatta would agree. Yet too often we've seen our innovations commercialised overseas because of a lack of support at home. The Future Made in Australia plan changes that by fostering innovation and ensuring that Australian ideas are turned into Australian jobs and products. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're investing in research and development, supporting start-ups and encouraging collaboration between businesses and government. By doing so, we're creating an ecosystem that nurtures innovation and turns great ideas into commercial successes. Whether it's in technology, health care or manufacturing, Australia has the potential to lead the world in innovation, and we're providing the support needed to make that happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our focus on innovation isn't just about new products. It's about improving productivity, increasing competitiveness and ensuring that Australian businesses can succeed on the global stage. This is how we will build a more prosperous future for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In an increasingly interconnected world, Australia must ensure its place as a leader in the global economy. The Future Made in Australia plan is designed to do just that, by focusing on sectors where we can compete and win on the world stage. We're not just investing in industries of the future. We're also strengthening our trade relationships and ensuring that Australian businesses have the support they need to access international markets. By building strong supply chains and enhancing export capabilities, we're ensuring that Australian-made products are sought after all around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't just about boosting exports. It's about ensuring that Australia is a country that adds value, creates high-quality products and is competitive in the global marketplace. We're providing the tools and support that Australian businesses need and, in doing so, we're creating the jobs and the economic opportunities that our communities need right here at home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 supports Australia's path to net zero. But, more than that, it will help to realise our potential to become a renewable energy superpower, securing Australia's place in a changing global landscape. This bill is about combining the might of Australian industry, energy, resources, skills and investment to build a stronger, more diversified and resilient economy, and a better future for all Australians.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300124" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TINK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  As Australia's response to the Inflation Reduction Act, introduced in the USA in August 2022, the Future Made in Australia legislation, or the FMIA, presents us with an important opportunity to decarbonise our economy and boost economic growth by reinvigorating our manufacturing sector  and fostering innovation. Importantly, by encouraging and facilitating private sector investment to power the net-zero transition, the FMIA could help build a more diversified, resilient and future focused economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That ambition could not be more aligned with my community's aspirations, with many across North Sydney already pursuing increased productivity and output via innovation and investment, because my community recognises the world is changing and it wants Australia to be part of that change. Along with many others, my community has been frustrated that the nation has not made the most of its comparative advantages and has failed to leverage its workforce, abundant renewable resources and land. Ultimately, they recognise that the FMIA provides us with an opportunity to increase the sophistication and complexity of our economy whilst working to meet our climate targets as we move away from our history as a nation reliant on trade built on everything we can grow, dig and ship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Done well, the FMIA opens the door to a future in which Australia is no longer reliant on fossil fuels but is rather a global exporter of renewable energy; a nation where high-energy goods are manufactured using renewable energy and exported as zero-carbon products and where renewable energy components like batteries, innovative new solar panels and wind turbines are made and exported right here; a nation that is recognised for our capacity to export renewable energy electrons to neighbouring countries like Singapore whilst domestically we use our own 100 per cent certified renewable energy sources to make green hydrogen and ammonia; and, finally, a nation where other related exports like engineering expertise and software services thrive and grow—a nation we'd all wish to live in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To achieve emissions reduction at the pace and scale needed, however, we must make every decision from here on out by looking at it through a whole-of-economy lens, ensuring our actions are clearly directed and coordinated. While the headlines around the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 were initially encouraging, the devil is shown to be in the detail, and it is crucial that we examine whether the FMIA will be strong enough to overcome the challenges we face whilst enabling us to embrace the opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Seen by many as a visionary step towards revitalising our domestic industries and fortifying our economy, the legislation does indeed hold promise. However, having discussed it broadly with my community, I have found several areas where we believe it could be strengthened. They include the following. At its core, the FMIA legislation is designed to promote local manufacturing and innovation, aiming to ensure Australian businesses and industries are competitive on a global scale. While the legislation is intended to encourage the transition to renewable energy, support local enterprises, encourage investment in advanced technologies and net-zero industries, and secure jobs for Australians, the reality is that it may fall short if it fails to clearly articulate an overarching and single-minded mission. Having scattergun goals spread across multiple areas is a surefire way to achieve little, and many in my community would like to see this mission oriented economic policy tightened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most significant criticisms of the FMIA legislation is its lack of emphasis on long-term decarbonisation. While the legislation addresses the immediate needs and supports of short-term goals, it fails to outline a comprehensive long-term vision, and ultimately many are left asking the question: what mission is this legislation seeking to achieve? Throughout history, extraordinary things have been done when the mission has been clear, whether that was mobilising economies during the world wars or the efforts to get a human on the moon. The governments involved at those times were unequivocal about what they were seeking to do. In this context, my community would like to see the mission for the FMIA legislation more clearly articulated, and we would like to see that mission become known as 'to be decarbonising Australia's economy'. As it stands, fossil fuel companies and projects are not explicitly excluded from funding under the FMIA, and there is no clear link to decarbonisation goals or climate considerations. Rather, Australia's emissions reduction targets and obligations under the Paris Agreement are not included in the legislative objects, meaning the overarching goal for the scheme is not in line with our need to urgently decarbonise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To rectify this, the FMIA Bill should explicitly rule out any assistance for fossil fuel projects or investments, including carbon capture and storage projects, as many of these projects, particularly the carbon capture and storage ones, currently have a poor track record and present material risks for Australia's transition to net-zero emissions. To this end, I'll be supporting crossbench amendments, recommended by many stakeholders, that would enable that exclusion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the FMIA legislation includes provisions for oversight, but these mechanisms are not particularly rigorous. Without stringent enforcement, the potential for misuse or ineffective limitation remains high. In facilitating investment it's paramount that the government avoids a situation, whether it is real or perceived, where taxpayer money is used to fund pet projects. Investment decisions must be transparent and driven by independent expert economic analysis and there must be clear and compelling public value when resources are diverted from one industry to another. Financial support must be tied to clear policy goals, not distributed on the whim of politicians or governments. To ensure the effective use of public money, taxpayer funds should be allocated only where that assistance is needed in a transition phase as ultimately it is imperative that industries supported can stand on their own two feet after receiving an initial leg-up from the government. The government must avoid propping up industries that are not economic or are unlikely to become so. As the Productivity Commission has warned:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If poorly designed, industry policy such as the FMIA can be costly for governments, act as a form of trade protection, and distort the allocation of Australia's scarce resources towards activities that Australia is not best placed to undertake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure the judicious use of taxpayer dollars, then, there must be a sustainable and future focused policy agenda that allows businesses to plan confidently. Those I have spoken to have clearly stated they would like to see the FMIA investment linked to the National Interest Framework, with the basic requirement being for all funded projects and entities to be within the scope of a sector assessment. As it currently stands, however, this is not the case. The Productivity Commission has recommended limiting FMIA support to sectors that pass the National Interest Framework sector assessments. Again, I will support amendments moved by my crossbench colleagues that would implement that recommendation. Overall, the National Interest Framework is absolutely welcomed, as it is seen as an appropriate way to assess sectorial intervention, but, by tying investors to it, the FMIA funding will be targeted towards our national policies, which in turn will ensure an effective of use of public money and that resources are only diverted from industries where there is a clear and strong public upside.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission has also noted the importance of using clear and robust policy frameworks to inform interventions and to ensure compelling value for money and the delivery of industry assistance. Whether public funding is put to its best use will rest on the strengths of the sector assessment process. However, it is currently unclear to what extent initiatives already announced as part of the FMIA plan, such as the Solar Sunshot program and the Battery Breakthrough Initiative, were subjected to this sort of sector assessment prior to announcement. To boost public confidence in these projects and the overall operation of the bill, the government should provide clarity as to whether these projects will be subjected to the same rigorous and transparent sector assessments as future projects will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the community benefit principles contained in this legislation are an important and welcome inclusion as they ensure the public-private investment the FMIA attracts will flow to communities in ways that benefit local workers and businesses. The bill requires decision-makers of the FMIA's support to have regard to these community benefit principles to ensure the benefits of these programs are widely shared. However, stakeholders have raised numerous questions about the principles and there is clearly a lack of clarity, leaving it open to the interpretation of what constitutes a benefit to a community and how it can be measured. It also leaves the door open to future regulations redefining and repurposing the community benefit provisions of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Capital Forum have raised questions regarding theses benefits, including how the benefits will be measured and what their success would look like, how equity is measured and even whether the environmental benefits are more valuable than a program that enhances skilled employment. To address these questions, the government should clarify how the community benefit principles will apply in practice, how companies will be held responsible for following them and how communities will be able to hold companies and projects to account. This may be achieved by including a requirement that, where the secretary undertakes public consultation, members of the public are afforded a reasonable opportunity to provide comment directly to the secretary, who must then include an explanation of how public comments were considered in the final report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, on top of everything previously outlined, the current legislation does not adequately address the need for collaboration with Indigenous communities. Indigenous Australians have a unique role in the nation's cultural and economic landscape. Their involvement in future manufacturing and innovation initiatives is not just a matter of social justice; it's also a strategic advantage. Given this, I believe this legislation should include specific programs to support Indigenous businesses and entrepreneurs, ensuring First Nations perspectives are integrated into decision-making processes related to manufacturing and innovation. Including a standalone First Nations benefit-sharing principle that recognises the need for First Nations communities and traditional owners to participate in and benefit from the FMIA initiatives would strengthen this bill. Furthermore, by providing funding for initiatives that promote Indigenous participation in technology and advanced industries, this initiative could truly help shape the way in which First Nations communities currently participate in the wider economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, while the FMIA legislation presents a positive step forward for our manufacturing and innovation sectors on the pathway to decarbonisation, it is not without its flaws. To truly secure a prosperous future for Australia, we need to address the gaps and the weaknesses that have been identified through collaboration and consultation. By strengthening the focus of this legislation, by creating a clear link between the National Interest Framework and the FMIA funding, by requiring projects and entities to be within the scope of a sector assessment to be eligible for support, by explicitly ruling out the use of FMIA on fossil fuel and carbon capture and storage projects, by tightening up the community benefit principles to safeguard them against future governments, and by including a standalone community benefit principle for First Nations participation and engagement, this bill would be greatly strengthened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is our collective responsibility to advocate for legislation that meets the needs of today while preparing for the challenges and opportunities of tomorrow. I look forward to further debate around this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  My electorate of Gilmore on the New South Wales south coast is an absolutely beautiful place to live. With pristine beaches and bushland and friendly, creative communities, it's the perfect place to raise a family or to retire. It's world famous for its white sands and towering forests. But the south coast is so much more than a tourist destination; it's also a great place to make things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Internationally recognised businesses like Air Affairs Australia, now known as QinetiQ, and Alkath's Global Defence Solutions are manufacturing things locally to support the Navy's only air station, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span>, at Nowra as well as defence more broadly. The Albatross Aviation Technology Park, just outside of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> was designed specifically for defence industry to support defence and aviation industries, boosting defence support and advanced manufacturing industries, and creating and supporting local jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Gilmore we also have innovative local businesses building boats, making construction materials, producing chemicals, and manufacturing food and pharmaceuticals. Bomaderry is home to Manildra's Shoalhaven Starches, which is the largest private employer in the Shoalhaven. Shoalhaven Starches is the largest wheat starch and gluten plant of its kind in the world and operates in conjunction with a world-first ethanol distillery to extract value-added products from 100 per cent of the wheat grain by using the most advanced industry technology available. But, like most businesses of this size, Shoalhaven Starches is always looking to the future to reduce emissions and reduce energy consumption to remain profitable. That's where a Future Made in Australia can help with developing technologies to reduce emissions so we can make more things here in Australia and in our region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also pleased to say that we have inspiring community organisations like SHASA, the South Coast Health and Sustainability Alliance in the Eurobodalla, that are championing renewable energy, sustainability and resilience projects in the region. Whether it's encouraging people to take up EVs through their EV expo or creating bushfire havens with renewable energy, including solar and batteries, SHASA members understand the importance and opportunities for individuals, community organisations and businesses in reducing emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The possibilities in my electorate for small businesses, renewable energy solutions and defence partnerships are endless, and this government's Future Made in Australia Bill will ensure that we can take advantage of these opportunities in Gilmore and right across Australia. This government's Future Made in Australia plan is a no-brainer. Its goal is to make more things here in Australia, to create jobs and to ensure that our economy becomes more resilient and secure into the future. It's a long-term vision to grow our nation into a renewable energy superpower and to encourage companies to invest in new projects and create new jobs, particularly in regional areas like my electorate of Gilmore. People living in Gilmore often have to leave the area for work, and those setting up new and innovative businesses often struggle to keep up with their counterparts in the city. The Future Made in Australia plan will make the most of our natural resources and will give people in regional communities across our nation a chance to seize economic opportunities closer to home. Making more in Gilmore—that's actually a great slogan—will mean our innovators, our researchers, our engineers and our manufactures can work close to home. They can raise their families on our beautiful coast and enjoy the beaches and the bush. They can have the best of both worlds. Investing in a future made in Australia will bring a new generation of secure, well-paid jobs to our regions and towns alike.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's plan is to build economic security for the long term by investing in the next generation of jobs and opportunities, to deliver reform that holds no-one back, and to drive progress, leaving no-one behind, no matter where they live. A shining example of one enterprise that has proven that things made in Australia—in Gilmore—are world-class is Air Affairs Australia—now known as QinetiQ—an advanced manufacturing centre and aerospace training services facility at South Nowra. The Shoalhaven has a significant Defence industry, and Air Affairs is a world-leading specialist in manufacturing and training with a focus on navy. Air Affairs products are in demand globally, and prior to COVID exports made up 70 per cent of its business. I'm told that this is because much of the equipment that Australian Defence Force sourced was imported. When COVID hit, those supply chains were interrupted or destroyed. We didn't have much of the critical equipment needed so, in an impressive pivot, Air Affairs was there as a recognised and proven defence industry manufacturer, and now 90 per cent of its products are sold domestically.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Air Affairs is the perfect example of a local, clean manufacturing facility that is making things in Australia. It is creating local jobs and apprenticeships, and providing navy aviation technician training to supply our local Navy base—what could be better? Air Affairs has apprentices at every level across all trades: manufacturing, processing, electrical and painting, mostly with graduates from local schools. They provide a one-stop shop for Defence products, using automation to complement their workers, including with 3D printers and some of the most complex machinery you've ever seen, overseen by mechanical engineers. We need more of this. We need more local jobs, more local training, more homegrown products. We need a future made in Australia and the opportunities it brings. Another Nowra-based business, Alkath's Global Defence Solutions, is a family owned company that has been building and supplying mobile field shelters for the ADF for more than 20 years. These deployable shelters are used as hospitals, kitchens, operations centres and accommodation, but the best part is that the team at GDS live and work in Nowra and support the Shoalhaven community. These two local companies are creating job opportunities, training local people and making things—all on the South Coast. That's exactly what this government's vision for a future made in Australia is all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Making our future here in Australia depends on workers, their skills and education, on research and on infrastructure, which is why we're building on the work we've already done. We're expanding the skills of our workforce with fee-free TAFE places, we're investing in our universities' science and cyber capabilities, and our comprehensive plan for cleaner, cheaper energy for all Australians will drive advanced manufacturing and open up opportunities across the country. This important legislation will facilitate private investment in job creation in industries of the future in order to benefit our economy. This government's Future Made in Australia plan is about maximising the economic and industrial benefits of the global transformation to net zero, and securing Australia's place in a changing global, economic and strategic landscape. It will help Australia build a stronger, more diversified and resilient economy powered by renewable energy. It will create more secure, well-paid jobs and encourage and facilitate the private-sector investment required to make Australia an indispensable part of the global net zero economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Made in Australia Bill recognises our future growth prospects lie at the intersection of our industrial resources, skills and energy bases, and our attractiveness as an investment destination. It combines our comparative advantage in renewable energy with traditional strengths in resources and manufacturing to build new opportunities, including in critical-minerals processing, green metals, clean energy technologies and low-carbon liquid fuels. The world needs Australia's resources. We can make things here and turn our resources into products that the world wants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Future Made in Australia vision will put the talents of our people and our incredible natural resources to work making things here so we are not shipping things overseas and importing them back as finished products. We know this is possible because it's already happening. Companies are using Australian minerals to manufacture solar panels to put on our roofs. Researchers are making breakthroughs in science that will lead to new medicines. Under Labor we're generating 25 per cent more renewable energy, and we've ticked off enough renewable projects to power three million homes. Our Future Made in Australia plan is about giving an adrenaline boost to projects like these and making sure they have what they need to compete in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now the world is Australia's oyster, so let's make the most of that. Our world-class renewable energy resources make Australia well placed to produce green hydrogen at internationally competitive prices. Significant quantities of green iron, steel, alumina and aluminium will be required to support the energy transition globally and domestically. Both steel and aluminium are used in wind turbines, electric vehicles and grid infrastructure. However, traditional metals production is highly carbon intensive. Australia can develop a long-term comparative advantage in green metals by drawing on our abundant metal and renewable energy resources. These are the resources that will drive our economy and the global economy in the 21st century.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's potential to produce abundant renewable energy gives us a powerful advantage. We have the resources, we have the space and we have the opportunity to create a future made in Australia and to take advantage of the world's desire to transition to net zero. As the sunniest, windiest continent on earth, this is our moment. More than anywhere on earth, Australia is poised to gain new jobs, new industries and new skills. That's why we're investing in our people now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is investing $91 million over the next five years to accelerate the development of the clean energy workforce through expanded access to the New Energy Apprenticeship Program and investments in VET clean energy courses. We're expanding support for women training in male-dominated industries through $55.6 million for the Building Women's Careers Program and $38.2 million to support diversity in science, technology, engineering and maths. This is part of this government's targeted approach to meeting the skills needed for a future made in Australia, including $68.4 million to attract and retain the skilled industrial workforce needed to support defence industrial priorities. This is a smart plan to build an economy where manufacturing will become every bit as strong as mining. But we can't be left behind by the rest of the world. We need to start now. We must look forward and plan for Australia's future and invest in it today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that this bill is not about government replacing private investment. It's about government being a catalyst for investment and unlocking the private capital to build new projects, create new jobs and drive growth and prosperity. This government wants a more diversified economy and a more decentralised economy where workers and communities in every part of the country can share in the opportunities that lie before us. We need to open the doors to new opportunities right now. We need to plan for a future made in Australia right now. We don't have time to waste. This bill is at the heart of our government's vision for a stronger, more prosperous and more resilient Australian economy. This bill speaks to our unwavering determination to shape the future of Australia, not wait for the future to shape us. It's time to make the most of what we have and make more things here. It's time to make Australia wealthier. It's time to make Australia more secure, and it's time to make Australia more independent. That's what a Future Made in Australia is all about. It's an economic plan for a better future for all Australians.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="306489" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CALDWELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  Today we're contemplating the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024. It's a great tagline. Well done. As usual, Labor policy is guided by what can fit on a corflute at a polling booth. I can see the corflutes at the next election now: 'Labor supports a future made in Australia', perhaps with some subtle green and gold colouring to give that patriotic feeling to voters as they walk into the polling booth. This has no doubt been tested by focus groups. The government and everyone love things that are made here. We all have a sense of national pride and we want our country to be self-reliant and able to make stuff. What will the next Hills hoist or the next Victa lawnmower be? Will this bill reveal the next one of those things? I say it won't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we all agree on is that we want Australia to be a successful and competitive manufacturing nation. What we disagree on with the other side is how to make that happen and why on earth Labor would want to be a one-trick pony when Australian manufacturing could be so much more. I rise today to add my voice to the chorus of opposition to this disastrous and desperate proposal. What the corflutes won't say is that the Future Made in Australia isn't what Labor is making it out to be. Make no mistake: this is an ideological pursuit for the Labor Party. The coalition will oppose this bill because the more we hear about this plan the more we know it doesn't have any merit. What this plan actually is is a plan for pork-barrelling and more green energy financing, not the making of a strong, diversified and sustainable economy. This is a plan for more government intervention and handouts with strings attached, not genuine business investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a proud and strong manufacturing industry, and the coalition has always supported it, despite what those on the other side say. But that support requires strong economic management that gets Australia back on track. We've got to get the basics right: affordable and reliable energy, flexible workplaces, less regulation and a reliable tax system that incentivises and rewards investment. Labor's policies on energy, industrial relations and tax are all making Australia a less attractive place to do business. The benefits to enterprise from a government handout are more than outweighed by the antibusiness settings which have been introduced by the Albanese Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is literally all spin and no substance. The facts are clear: insolvencies in Australia are at record highs, productivity is down and businesses are struggling to just keep their doors open. Labor's plan for a future made in Australia has more spin than a Shane Warne leg break. As the shadow Treasurer has said, this is a political slogan in search of a policy. Economist after economist has criticised this policy. We're hearing more stories about the dodgy processes, the lack of economic scrutiny and the double standards that will apply to this program. Government can't solve the cost-of-living crisis by throwing billions of hard-earned taxpayer money around, and it most certainly can't solve the inflation spiral by doing the same. The Prime Minister might want to pick winners, but Australian families will continue to lose from Labor's reckless spending.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is actually a demonstration of Labor's wrong priorities. After watching the government spend the whole of 2023 promoting its divisive and flawed $500 million Voice proposal rather than focusing on cost-of-living relief, Australians were hopeful that 2024 might be the year when the Prime Minister focuses on taming inflation and getting prices down. Instead, the Prime Minister revealed a plan to spend even more money and make productivity worse, a plan that has failed to gain support from mainstream economists. Labor has given plenty of handouts to lobbyists and overseas corporations, many of whom have ways other than government handouts to raise finance, but Labor has no plan for struggling families and small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is in a full-blown cost-of-living and cost-of-doing-business crisis. Member after member on the other side of the chamber is blindly sleepwalking towards a model of selectively supporting manufacturing that will only guarantee one outcome: the continued manufacturing of high inflation. Australia is at the back of the pack when it comes to fighting inflation compared to our peer nations. We are the only G10 nation where core inflation has gone up compared to December. We are in an entrenched GDP per capita recession, with anaemic growth, which means households are going backwards. Around 19,000 businesses have entered insolvency since Labor came to office. For seats like mine in cities like the Gold Coast, that hurts families.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the highest on record since ASIC began collecting that data. Since Labor came to office, prices have gone up by 10 per cent, personal income taxes have gone up by 20 per cent, real wages have collapsed by nine per cent, household savings have gone down by 10 per cent and the family that has a typical $750,000 mortgage is around $35,000 worth off each year. This bill does nothing to alleviate these pressures on struggling families and businesses. This big-spending $4 billion cash splash is only going to make inflation worse. Households are going to great lengths to keep their heads above water, working more hours and taking on extra jobs. They're digging deep into their savings and making a lot of sacrifices to try to balance their household budgets, all because the Prime Minister and Treasurer can't show restraint in their spending.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just like households, governments need to manage their budgets and live within their means, but the Albanese Labor government has shown weak economic leadership once more. With this policy, the government is taking from household budgets to bolster the balance sheet of hand-picked projects and companies that support their political agenda. That is not responsible economic management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know a lot about what the bill doesn't do, but what does this legislation try to achieve? These bills expand the role of Export Finance Australia and ARENA and establish a national interest framework that retrospectively underpins the government's Future Made in Australia policy. Let me tell you: the National Interest Framework will be conveniently interpreted as a political interest framework very quickly. The accompanying omnibus bill expands Export Finance Australia's remit to fund domestic industries and nominates the Minister for Finance as an additional responsible minister. The omnibus bill also expands ARENA's functions from pure R&amp;D and demonstration to allow it to support manufacturing, deployment and commercialisation. These changes to ARENA are really just a slush fund for one minister. This legislation fundamentally changes the purpose, duties and roles of ARENA, but they won't be putting that on a corflute. No, they'll skip the part about how the Future Made Australia is a secret vehicle to drive their renewables-only energy agenda. This is not just a tagline; it's a Trojan Horse to sneak past Australians that this government is absolutely obsessed with delivering expensive renewables.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ARENA has always been a research and development agency. This is clear in its remit, the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech. Labor in opposition opposed even expanding that remit to cover sensible net zero related R&amp;D expenditure, including into carbon capture and storage and into blue hydrogen. How times have changed. Now they're expanding that remit even further, into deployment and manufacturing, and why? It is because it suits their interests and that of their donors. If ARENA is being given the remit to cover deployment, why does the Clean Energy Finance Corporation even need to exist?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But Labor's changes are more insidious than they have led the public to believe. This is because the bill gives the Minister for Climate Change and Energy the ability to boost its funding at the stroke of a pen. No parliamentary oversight, no scrutiny or accountability—just ministerial discretion to splash taxpayer money wherever the minister chooses. It is a delegated piece of legislation with which the government can roll out up to $4 billion to support their ideologically aligned corporations and projects in an election year. This is a slush fund plain and simple.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian taxpayers are already on the hook for Labor's inflation, and it will get worse. Labor has spent $315 billion in new spending since the election. That's over $30,000 per Australian household. I can tell you that, in my electorate and all around Australia, Australians do not feel like they are reaping the benefits of an extra $30,000 worth of spending on them. This has fuelled inflation. It's eating into living standards. It's expenditure where Australians ultimately foot the bill. They're not seeing a direct benefit themselves. Australian families are paying the price for Labor's mismanagement, with 12 interest rate hikes, some of the most stubborn core inflation in the developed world and the higher taxes that come with it. Australian families shouldn't be paying for Labor's billion-dollar renewables re-election strategy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another problem with this legislation is that it puts the Treasurer and his department in the position to decide whether a sector of the Australian economy deserves investment. The Treasurer has never run a business and described his private-sector career as six long, long months, and he will now be setting the conditions for businesses to operate and seek funding under this plan. The analysis to green-light these investments will be guided by a Treasurer who has hardly worked in business and a department of bureaucrats who under this government have made a reputation for failing to understand business. This is not the way to build a healthy and productive economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Business Council have warned that these procurement rules are at risk of enabling this behaviour, while it risks subsidising businesses Australia would never have a comparative advantage in. The Business Council of Australia rightfully points out that this is important because there are taxpayer dollars at stake, but the BCA have also been clear that this is not the best path ahead. The best path is to get back to basics and get the fundamentals right. BCA President Bran Black has said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our competitors … are more investment-friendly environments based on old-fashioned fundamentals like tax and regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To reinvent our economy we must, as a point of national urgency, become a more competitive place to do business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission says that a $1 billion commitment to make more solar panels in Australia under Labor's Future Made in Australia program should be retrospectively subjected to a tougher national interest framework. Allowing sectors to bypass the National Interest Framework process would undermine its role in disciplining spending, yet Labor is already breaking their own rules when it suits them. We are not surprised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Key elements of Labor's Future Made in Australia agenda include the controversial PsiQuantum contract, which, of course, bypassed the National Interest Framework and sector assessments. There are serious questions to answer about the decision to make this investment, with it increasingly clear that Minister Husic decided to invest in this business independent of any departmental appraisal, analysis or recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Treasury was not consulted prior to the decision to invest in solar manufacturing, and their subsequent analysis has said that it is not a sound investment. The Productivity Commission were not consulted on the details of the proposed investment prior to their announcement, and we are already seeing that the policy is not effective. But the coalition is not the only one raising these serious concerns with Labor's plan. There is commentator after commentator jumping on board to point out the flaws in Labor's approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians want and deserve something better than a government playing politics with their money in pursuit of re-election. The coalition is working to ensure Australia can play to its strengths. We are looking to build a nation which is a mining, manufacturing and agricultural powerhouse and a leader in technology and innovation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  I'm very proud to be here today speaking about this great bill, the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024. I congratulate the minister, the member for Chifley, Ed Husic, for coming up with something that will create our cutting-edge future jobs in this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not surprising that the opposition are opposing anything to do with creating jobs for the future, manufacturing and real jobs with real wages for people of this nation. We need to secure jobs for the future generations of Australians. We need jobs that are rewarding and sustainable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I attended community meetings in my electorate over the weekend that just went past. Many of the families that attended spoke to me about their kids' future, what sort of work will be available and the sorts of careers their children and grandchildren may seek in a changing world. It is a rapidly changing world when it comes to technology; we can see it. The jobs of the future haven't even been thought of today. We're creating them at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's Future Made in Australia plan is about maximising the economic and industrial benefits of the global transformation to net zero and securing Australia's place in a changing global economic and strategic landscape. We all have a goal, and that goal is net zero. It will help Australia build a stronger, more diversified and more resilient economy powered by renewable energy; create more secure, well-paid jobs; and encourage and facilitate the private sector investment required to make Australia an indispensable part of the global net-zero economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This plan recognises that our future growth prospects lie at the intersection of our industries, resources, skills and energies and our attractiveness as an investment destination. It combines our comparative advantages in renewable energy with traditional strengths in resources and manufacturing to build new opportunities, including in critical minerals, green metals processing, clean energy technologies and low carbon liquid fuels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill and omnibus bill deliver on key elements of the government's Future Made in Australia plan announced by the government in the 2024-25 budget. They impose rigour on government decision-making and help give investors the clarity and certainty they need to invest and unlock growth in our economy. It's really important that they have clarity and certainty to invest now, unlike with the previous government, who had 26, 27—I've lost count—29 different climate change policies. Who was going to invest in that particular political climate? No-one. We are committed to making more things here in Australia to build a stronger, more diversified and more resilient economy powered by clean energy and to create more secure well-paid jobs around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My home state was a manufacturing hub. It was a powerhouse of manufacturing. We had Holden, Chrysler—which then became Mitsubishi—Clark shoes, Rossi boots; there was a whole range of manufacturing jobs which have all sadly closed their doors in South Australia. But when you think back to one of South Australia's greatest initiatives, you think of General Motors Holden setting up in South Australia in partnership with the Holden family. It was a great premier at the time—I have to say it was a Liberal premier, Premier Playford—who had the vision and the insight to invest and incentivise GMH and others to build this great manufacturing factory. So good were the profits and the returns on it that then other manufacturing companies came to South Australia, like Chrysler, who created another motorcar that they built.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were one of the only countries in the world and one of the only states in Australia where you could do all the work from designing a motor vehicle through to the manufacturing and then take the motor vehicle to the showroom floor. We were one of only 13 countries that had that capability, and if the government of the day didn't come up with a plan to have that investment put in there with incentives, it would have never happened. That was a revolution for South Australia. It was a manufacturing revolution which also attracted, excluding the 8,000 to 11,000 people who directly worked at Holden in the fifties, another 50,000 to 70,000 jobs within the state in manufacturing. Because someone had the vision and the foresight to invest and our government invested in it, it attracted people all over and it was cutting-edge technology at the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are on the cusp of a second revolution in manufacturing through renewables. If we miss out, we'll end up worse off than a Third World country, because countries all around the world are trying to have investment and produce these cutting-edge jobs that we certainly need, and we need to turn our minds to the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, future advanced manufacturing jobs are very much on the minds of the companies operating out of Lot 14, which is a hub for innovating companies on the former Royal Adelaide Hospital site. Lot 14 is a world-class innovation district, bringing together a curated government, research and industry ecosystem focusing on advancing the defence, space, high-tech and creative industries, and it's a catalyst of innovation for the future and especially for the future skilled workforce. The district has become a beacon of South Australia's broader innovation ecosystem. Leveraging the power of collaboration—working together—Lot 14 strives to grow South Australia's productivity and to solve those complex global challenges, leading to greater economic, social and cultural prosperity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The innovation district is already home to global corporates. We've been able to attract global corporates that have invested big money in South Australia—such brands as Salesforce, Amazon Web Services and Airbus, who are co-located alongside each other and alongside highly respected organisations including the Australian Space Agency, the Australian Institute for Machine Learning, the Australian Cyber Collaboration Centre, and Stone &amp; Chalk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was delighted to hear recently that the company QuantX Labs, based in Lot 14 in my electorate, has been awarded two contracts, worth $2.7 million, to supply optical atomic clocks that will deliver precision navigation and timing capabilities to the Australian Defence Force. That's a product that we're manufacturing entirely in South Australia and that will go to the Defence Force, instead of being brought in from overseas, and they will be exporting as well. They're already looking at exporting around the world. I've had the privilege of seeing firsthand their state-of-the-art facility at Lot 14, and many of the ministers have come down and visited it with me. This is a tremendous result for QuantX Labs and for Australia's sovereign capability to support the brave women and men who wear our nation's uniforms. I look forward to seeing young South Australians in my state—and in fact, with this bill, young people all around Australia—pursue rewarding careers, careers that have a future in them, in advanced manufacturing companies like QuantX Labs for decades and decades to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget includes a $23 billion Future Made in Australia package focused on unlocking private investment at scale in the net-zero transformation and strengthening our economic resilience. The Future Made in Australia legislative package will include community benefit principles which will ensure that these investments are made in ways that benefit the whole community, including local manufacturers, and require public investments to be made in a way that strengthens domestic industrial capabilities and local supply chains. The government's $22.7 billion Future Made in Australia budget package includes production tax incentives for hydrogen and critical minerals. We have the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund, the Solar Sunshot and Battery Breakthrough initiatives, the National Interest Account and other initiatives to better attract and enable investments and make Australia an indispensable part of the global supply chain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is of particular interest in my home state of South Australia, which thanks to our transformational Premier, Peter Malinauskas, and our state Minister for Energy and Mining, Tom Koutsantonis, is working together with the federal government here in Canberra and making determined progress to make the most of the global energy transition by taking advantage of our unique combination of sun, wind and valuable minerals in the Upper Spencer Gulf and surrounding areas. SA's renewable energy share has surged from one per cent in 2007 to 74 per cent. If that's not progress, and if that's not people investing in renewables and creating jobs in renewable energy, then what is? We are Australia's renewable energy super powerhouse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australia is also home to Australia's richest copper resource, with global demand for copper, iron ore et cetera set to surge for use in sustainable technologies such as electric vehicles and wind turbines. In the Upper Spencer Gulf, we know we have superior magnetite iron ore resources, essential for the production of green steel, for which demand is set to surge as the world seeks to decarbonise. You look at our trading partners that buy this steel, and it's mainly Korea, Japan and China. In Korea and Japan, for example, they have car manufacturing. They have small geographic lands and countries where they can't have massive wind farms and solar farms. What they're looking at is to be able to have, for example, green steel manufactured in their manufacturing industries so they can reduce their carbon output. They are watching very carefully, and, if we miss out, they will go elsewhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what the opposition has to realise. There are millions and billions to be lost if this bill is not supported. We need to make sure that we are at the cusp of this and that we are right there at the beginning with these changes in technology. We know that our competitors around the world, including the US and Europe, are putting billions of dollars into this area to incentivise companies et cetera to be able to create these cutting-edge jobs and this cutting-edge technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key to unlocking our full potential is our critical minerals, which is why the South Australian state government and the private sector are progressing plans for a new desalination plant and pipeline network called Northern Water. SA is seeking to harness renewable energy resources into hydrogen by building the world's largest hydrogen power station at Whyalla. Hydrogen is also an essential part of the production of green steel, so we'll be able to continue to export that steel that goes into those motor vehicle manufacturing outlets in China, Korea, Japan and other places that we export to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Collectively, these measures have the potential to generate billions of dollars of economic activity and create thousands of jobs in the future. This will create new opportunities for my home state's heavy industry sector to decarbonise processes and to become more competitive against imported goods. That's why this bill is so critical to South Australia. It will return manufacturing to Australia's regions through a transition to globally competitive capabilities, led by the global push to produce green iron and steel. That will be one of the biggest parts of all of this—being able to lower those emissions when we're producing steel for our partners that buy our steel so they can then have their carbon credits reduced as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thousands of new local jobs will be created, and this means new local jobs in construction and operations. This is a spin-off. I spoke earlier about the fifties, with General Motors and the incentives that the government then gave. This is the spin-off that will create thousands of jobs, especially for our First Nations communities. These jobs are real jobs here in Australia manufacturing Australian goods—real Future Made in Australia jobs. At the federal level, our plan will help mobilise the private capital that we need to make the most of the big changes in the global economy and to implement key Future Made in Australia budget initiatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, when I think of manufacturing in this country, especially our car manufacturing—I know that, in your own home state, there was Toyota and Ford—when it first started, it created real jobs. It was cutting-edge technology. Governments incentivised it with millions of dollars, to begin with, and then continued to support it. But, for every $37 per assembly-line worker that was subsidised, it created more than $80 to $90 in the economy. That is a real spinner in terms of creating an economy that produces real jobs and real wages but also assists the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what the opposition has to think about with this particular bill. This is about the future of our children and our grandchildren, and, as I said, we are on the cusp of this cutting-edge technology. If we miss out, we'll end up way down there with the countries that have no manufacturing. We know that those on the other side did all that they could in 2013 to chase out General Motors-Holden from my state, causing the collapse of approximately 30,000 jobs.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  I am always happy to rise to speak on bills such as the so-called Future Made in Australia Bill 2024. I like to look at all of the bills that come through the House through a specific lens for areas in regional and rural Australia like my electorate of Cowper and the businesses and manufacturers in my electorate of Cowper. Unfortunately, as with so many bills brought into this House, the name of this bill is misleading and overly simplistic. It would have been more honest to have called this the 'Renewables Made in Australia to the Detriment of the Majority of Other Manufacturers Bill'. That would have been more apt and more simplistic. The name of the bill effectively implies that it will assist the lion share of our local manufacturers, both small and medium enterprises, in regional and rural Australia. It is just a fallacy. It's just not true. In my electorate, it is these businesses that support our local economies, that employ our population and that produce innovative and locally sourced products across a wide range of industries, from furniture to food, clothing and energy-efficient light bulbs, for example. These businesses that produce these products are so proud to do so and stand tall.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this intended bill, we will continue to see these small and medium businesses being crushed under the burden of rising production costs and cumbersome industrial relations challenges. These businesses are desperately balancing and rebalancing their books to keep the lights on and the doors open. I was in Macksville on the weekend. I went to the local coffee shop there. It's just a small coffee shop. The owner there told me how her electricity bill has gone up from $4,000 to $6,000 a quarter to run a small fridge, a copy machine and some lights. She told me about the butcher around the corner whose refrigeration bill has gone from $6,000 to $10,000 a quarter. We are talking about a small butcher's. He hasn't increased his costs. He's got to absorb that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Manufacturers would have thought, reading the title of this bill: 'Thank goodness. The government actually has recognised our struggles and is actively creating avenues for us to keep up with market forces.' Well, I am sorry. You might as well switch off now, because there is nothing like that in there for you in the regions. I would like to think that in this place we would like to see more products designed and manufactured in Australia both for our own population and for the export market. I would also like to believe in this place we would like to protect our nation's sovereignty and that everyone would like to see ongoing solutions to weaknesses in our supply chains that were laid bare during the pandemic. I do believe that everyone in this place also recognises our potential as a nation when it comes to a combination of energy resource capabilities. We all want ongoing employment opportunities and we all want to see a secure economy. But, respectfully, where and how we differ is on what our nation's balance of priorities in this area should be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will try to break down into digestible terms what this bill does include and why we in the coalition believe it to be both ineffective and ill conceived. In fact, I will go a step further. To be truly objective, I'll use the words 'economists' and 'industry experts' lest I be accused of politicising the issue. In basic terms, this bill expands the role of Export Finance Australia and ARENA and establishes the so-called National Interest Framework that retrospectively underpins the government's Future Made in Australia policy. The accompanying omnibus bill expands Export Finance Australia's remit to fund domestic industries and nominates the Minister for Finance as an additional responsible minister. The omnibus bill also expands ARENA's functions from a pure R&amp;D and demonstration role to support manufacturing, deployment and commercialisation. That sounds straightforward and simple, but each of those changes is fraught with danger and unintended knock-on effects. In very real terms, it demonstrate an arrogance of 'government knows best'. The people who know best are the manufacturers and the producers, the people who have been doing it for year after year, decade after decade and generation after generation. This is what we fear in the regions. We fear the government arrogance, and that sentiment strikes fear into economists and entrepreneurs alike.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The notion that the government or in this case individual ministers have their finger on the pulse of the competitive manufacturing market is a truly bizarre one. Our own Treasurer, and I'm quite surprised by this, described his time in the private sector as 'six long, long months'. It truly does give an insight into the Treasurer's thinking and experience—or lack of experience. Having been in business for 16 years on my own, and I know the member for Fisher was in business for many years, I can say that 'six long months' gives a real insight.</span>

                    </a>  He's supposedly running the joint, and he and his fellow career staffers and political ministers will ultimately determine where billions of dollars of taxpayer money will be directed. It will be a captain's call, a Treasurer's pick. As the government appointed head of the Productivity Commission, Danielle Wood, recently lamented:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We risk creating a class of businesses that is reliant on government subsidies, and that can be very effective in coming back for more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Welcome to the age of entitlement for captain's picks in certain areas of manufacturing. That's exactly what this bill is about to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With our current economic reality, there is no room for error when it comes to government investment. Currently $22.7 billion of taxpayer money is at risk, and if we are to have any hope of combating inflation and stimulating growth, an investment of that magnitude has to be a sure thing. I'm not a wowser; I don't mind a punt. But I never bet above my limit and I never bet with other people's money, and that is what this government is doing. They are betting above the limit and they're betting with the taxpayer's money. You see the ads on TV: 'gamble responsibly' and 'you win some, you lose more'. These are the ads that the government is now refusing to remove despite the recommendations by the former member for Dunkley. It seems really ironic. That slogan should apply to the minister and the government here. You win some, you lose more. This better be a sure thing because you will be losing the taxpayers' money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces the National Interest Framework, giving the government power to identify and invest in projects that are deemed of national interest. This means the government will facilitate private investments. Priority industries will be identified under two streams: the net zero transformation stream and the economic resilience and security stream. The net zero transformation stream will be focused on sectors that make a substantial contribution to achieving net zero, while the economic resilience and security stream will centralise on sectors that the government deems are critical to our resilience and that currently need government support to get beyond a starting point. Let me talk about net zero. We have an obligation to look after our planet. Absolutely, we do. We are working together, albeit differently, to achieve that. But let's look at the real facts. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is 0.04 per cent. Australia emits 1.3 per cent of that 0.04 per cent, yet with this bill we are hurtling down a road that will impose an impost of billions of dollars on the taxpayer for something that we, as Australians on both sides of the floor, have made much progress in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why should we exclude other manufacturers from being able to access this type of funding? Again, it comes down to a captain's call. To obtain Future Made in Australia support, businesses must meet community benefit principles of promoting safe and secure jobs that are well-paid, have good conditions and produce more skilled and inclusive workforces that invest in training and skills development and that engage collaboratively in achieving positive outcomes for all communities. They all sound reasonable on paper. There's no doubt about that. That's the ambition of the nation. How will that benefit the existing manufacturers in my electorate of Cowper who are ready to expand but who might not be ready to meet that criteria?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the net zero transformation stream, we're actually ignoring the current realities when it comes to our global competitors. The government announced this policy earlier with a $1 billion publicly funded initiative to establish an entire solar panel chain in Australia. The spend was presented in the headlines as a step towards creating a manufacturing base for solar products in our sunburnt country. And who can do it better—right? But the reality is that our current domestic solar efforts are no more than assembly lines for Chinese products. I'm not saying that to be dramatic. It's a fact. It's a reality. We are bringing over Chinese products and putting them on an assembly line to be put together—nothing more. That's not manufacturing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened to the member for Fowler, who's not in the chamber at the moment. She so eloquently noted in her own address on this topic that to establish such industrial capability would require an investment not of a measly $1 billion but many times that. And then we'd still not be competing with China for customers outside our own borders—with a country that not only leads this sector with low-cost but high-quality products but also is supported by having a massive trained workforce at its fingertips. We cannot be blindly arrogant enough to believe that we can compete in that arena. We will continue to import from China. We will continue to just put things together—little Lego blocks. It's equivalent to flogging a dead horse; it truly is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the coalition were putting forward a bill with this title we'd handle things differently. We would acknowledge the existing successful small and medium businesses and the burdens that they are currently carrying to keep themselves viable. We'd look at easing those burdens, not provide handouts to individual companies for them to become dependent on. We'd look at tax reforms for successful manufacturers, not at avenues for those without successful business plans to live perpetually off the government purse because they chose products that aligned with the government ideology. We would acknowledge our significant strengths as a manufacturing, mining and agricultural leader and play to those strengths, rather than forcing government ideology and personal priorities onto a free market. We'd look at the crux of every issue. We'd look at lowering inflation, putting downward pressure on costs to businesses, and make it easier for those in manufacturing and regional or rural areas to get on with it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Politicians often get accused of thinking too short-term. I hear that. In my community, you hear it around, particularly from older Australians: 'Why is everything so short-term?' That's sometimes a fair criticism; it is. And sometimes it's not. Three-year terms don't help, as I'm sure most people would agree. I think Bob Hawke tried to deal with that—a little constitutional change in the 1980s—and it got voted down. Maybe you'd get a different result now, given that Australians have experienced four-year state and territory government terms now. But the truth is that we should do more long-term things, I reckon. I think particularly, though, we should welcome it when governments of either side bring forward propositions, bring forward legislation to the parliament that is about the long term. The Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 is absolutely about the long term for our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've always maintained that it's Labor governments that are called into being by the Australian people to do those big things. If you look through the history of our country, it's Labor governments that make the big changes, such as Medicare under Bob Hawke. We on the Labor side of politics spent 20 years trying to build a universal healthcare system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-GeneralInterjecting">An honourable member:</span>  Gough Whitlam.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HILL:</span>
                    </a>  That's right: Gough Whitlam had a crack. Then the Liberals got in, under Malcolm Fraser, and abolished it. Then Bob Hawke put it in, and you went to election after election after election promising to abolish Medicare, to abolish the universal healthcare system, until finally even this mob figured out that they couldn't win an election in this country without at least pretending to support Medicare. That's what they do: they pretend to support it. Similarly with the superannuation system: it was the Labor government that did that big long-term thing and put in the superannuation system. And of course this mob pretend to support it and then nibble away, nibble away, undermine, cut, cut, cut. It's a Labor government now that's building the early childhood education system. One of the smartest investments that our country could make if we wanted to be a wealthier country 20 or 30 years from now would be in the human capital of the next generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, a Future Made in Australia is about rebuilding the industrial base of our country. That's a big thing. It's a generational project; it's not going to happen this year or in five years. The fruits of this labour will be seen in the coming 10 or 20 years and beyond as we rebuild industries and bring back jobs that have been lost overseas. The record of this mob over there: about a decade ago they stood up at the dispatch box and dared car industry to leave Australia. They chased them out of our country and then cheered them on as they left. Well, we have a different view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the world has also changed. It's really important that we understand the context for the Future Made in Australia legislation and investments. We learned some lessons from COVID about supply-chain resilience, that the just-in-time economy—which pure economists, perhaps over the neoliberal era, an era of unchallenged globalisation, would say made sense in textbooks, in order to maximise your wealth—carries enormous risks when it's disrupted, as it was during the pandemic. We couldn't make medical equipment here. We found how vulnerable we were with pharmaceuticals. If you want to have a look at strategic vulnerability, have a look at our fuel resilience in our industrial base—the geopolitical overlay of increasing uncertainty, with wars and conflicts breaking out around the world and the greatest risk of conflict in our region that we've seen for decades. But it is also about competition, because other countries are cottoning on to this, too. The concept of 'friendsuring' is out there, as we think about how we rebalance our reliance on vulnerable supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All these things set the context for the Future Made in Australia agenda. Manufacturing is actually still the largest single employment sector in my electorate in south-east Melbourne. I'm proud to represent and have part of the great south-east Melbourne industrial precinct in Bruce, shared with Isaacs and Holt. The members for Isaacs and Holt and I talk about this often, at the heart of that great nationally significant manufacturing precinct. And manufacturing jobs are good jobs. They're jobs that are increasingly high wage, high skill and high value. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I talked in my first speech about success in manufacturing being a bit like the story of agriculture in many senses over a hundred years or more. More investment in technology, more investment in skills and more investment in science and research, and knowledge capitalisation means higher productivity and higher wealth. There are not always more jobs but there are better jobs. There's no great argument with those facts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But success in manufacturing in the years to come relies on skills, technology and cheap power. We'll need to reclaim the advantage we had through the 1960s and 1970s of cheap, ubiquitous energy. And renewable energy is the cheapest form of new power. The economics are clear. The government gets it, economists get it and industry gets it. Pretty much the only people left in the country that don't get it are those opposite. They hear the word 'renewables' and their little brains explode. I should issue a trigger warning before I talk about renewables. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Reconstruction Fund with its $15 billion of loans and equity investments to support new investments in priority sectors and a $392 million industry growth program both sit alongside the Future Made in Australia agenda, because we need to do more. The old neoliberal consensus that's dominated thinking around this stuff for the last few decades along with untrammelled globalisation just don't work anymore. The world has changed and we have to change too. Other developed nations have figured this out, and Australia must not get left behind. This is not new protectionism, as those opposite keep crying. It's not. It's not about putting walls up. It's about government being a partner in building the foundations to support new investment to come into those sectors that we need—to build new enterprises, new sectors and new firms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians do understand change and we understand risk. We're a pragmatic people. We live on an island continent at the bottom of a region with 3½ billion or more people. The world doesn't owe us a living. We've got the most enormous opportunities, we're in the fastest growing region in human history. The world's economic centre has been moving from Europe towards Asia, right above us, faster than at any time in recorded human history. That rate of change is accelerating. Geopolitical competition is already expressing itself in conflicts in Europe and the Middle East and the risk of further, and our own region is the focus of this competition. The transition of billions of people from low and middle incomes to high-middle incomes and the transition from high emissions to low emissions—net zero emissions. We have the most to gain out of that transition of any OECD country because we've got the world's best renewable energy resources, if only we seize the opportunity and invest wisely in the industries that can take advantage of that and to partner with those industries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to read a quote from the now Assistant Minister for Future Made in Australia, Senator Ayres—a very good friend of mine. He gave a beautiful speech to the Sydney Institute not long ago, talking about how he grew up on a farm in regional New South Wales, the failure of his family's farm—no shame in that—and his family's journey. Again, I should have issued a trigger warning because it punches the opposition's mythology that no Labor members have actually lived on farms or grown up on farms and that no Labor members have worked in businesses.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HILL:</span>
                    </a>  See they get triggered, don't they. They just like to spout the propaganda and paint their stereotypes. Anyway, I recommend Senator Ayres' speech to you. I might send you a copy. It's a very good speech. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I underscore the point. Our agenda is a long way from the lazy complacency that characterised your wasted decade under Abbott and Turnbull and Morrison. That wasted decade of decay and dysfunction and dithering and division. The fighting amongst yourselves. I could get out the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nemesis</span> quotes, but time's short and I want to read that quote from Senator Ayres. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the Prime Minister said back in April, we need to aim high, be bold and build big to match the size of the opportunity in front of us. We have to get cracking. Australia has unlimited potential, but we do not have unlimited time. If we don't seize this moment, it will pass. If we don't take this chance, we won't get another. If we don't act to shape the future, the future will shape us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's exactly what the Future Made in Australia agenda is about—shaping the future and responding to the realities of the world, not the fantasy that we still live in the 1980s and can still run the same economic agenda, when the world has fundamentally changed. It's a very simple plan, in essence. We want Australia to be a country that makes more things here, because making more things here will grow our economy and create good jobs, spreading opportunity around the country, making the most of the natural resources and the advantages that we have—cheap, reliable renewable energy, a skilled workforce and an educated population—making more things here, making us more wealthy, more secure and more independent and building our resilience to future economic and strategic shocks. It's an economic plan for a better future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amidst of all this, what's the position of the opposition? I had the misfortune of being slightly wrongly advised by my office about the timing, so I ran in and had to endure two of the opposition's speeches—all that carping, nasty negativity that we've come to expect from the Leader of the Opposition. He's infecting them. Some of them are otherwise reasonable people. Actually, I had no idea who one of them was. I don't think I'd ever seen him before. Anyway, the other one seems liked quite a reasonable chap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad you're all sitting down. You'd be shocked to know that the opposition, the alternative government of the country, are saying no to making more things in Australia, just like they said no to tax cuts and no to the National Reconstruction Fund. They voted no to energy rebates; that was a high point for them, wasn't it? They say fee-free TAFE, that skills agenda that underpins manufacturing, is 'a waste of money'—that's a direct quote. They attack CSIRO. They don't like science, facts or evidence. They said Australian manufacturing is 'a graveyard'—pretty insulting to the incredible number of local businesses and workers in my electorate, but those are their words.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are saying no to the production tax credits at the moment. They say they're corporate welfare that might build new industries, like in critical and rare earth minerals, except when the opposition leader goes to Western Australia. Then they say: 'No, it doesn't mean no. It kind of means maybe, but we don't want to say that, because it kind of contradicts what we said. Maybe we mean yes, but we still say no.' They have no cost-of-living policies. You would have sat through question time. There were no questions on the cost of living. They have no policies on the cost of living. They've only got three policies. They're saying no to the Future Made in Australia policy, but they've only got three policies. I'll give them that; they do have three policies now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They've got their policy for more expensive housing, through letting people raid and trash their retirement savings, superannuation, to push up the cost of housing. That's a genius idea—push up the cost of housing to make it more affordable. That's one of their policies. They've got their 'higher grocery prices' policy, where they'll split up Coles and Woolworths and Coles will buy some Woolies stores and Woolies will buy some Coles stores. That's their 'push up grocery prices' policy. Their third big one is their higher power prices and the risky nuclear reactors that are too expensive and too slow. That's their energy policy. Sometime in the 2040s they'll have a few nuclear reactors that'll cost goodness knows how many hundreds of billions. That's their energy policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no doubt, though, that the biggest threat to Australian jobs and investment is not the things I've outlined—not the changes in the global economy, not the supply chain disruption and not the international uncertainty. It's the Liberal-National coalition's 'no, no, no'. It's just more of Peter Dutton's nasty negativity. That's all they've got, and it's not a surprise. As I said, it has been a decade or so since they chased the car industry out of Australia. Now they want to sacrifice another generation of Australian jobs by saying no to the Future Made in Australia policy.</span>

The Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 is the principal bill. It comes in with the Future Made in Australia (Omnibus Amendments No. 1) Bill 2024. As I said, these bills are quite utopian in their aspirations, because they fail to address the fundamentals that will allow Australia to actually make things competitively again because they support this concept that we can turn the country into a manufacturing powerhouse based on sometimes there and sometimes not there weather-dependent renewable energy turning the whole industrial base into being reliant on the wind and sun. The legislation also picks winners. It is not picking fundamentals that will improve our economy, like a low corporate tax rate or genuine industrial reforms so that businesses can be flexible, adjustable and develop productivity, all the fundamentals that will enable our manufacturing, or value-adding of our minerals, making cheap, nutritious food and value-adding in all the other value chains manufacturing things out of our own commodities. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just going into the details of these bills, they first of all create the National Interest Framework, which identifies which sectors are potential candidates for support under the Future Made in Australia policy. The legislation also defines this Orwellian concept of 'community benefit principles'. I thought, 'They are going to define a better corporate tax rate so companies look at Australia not as a high-taxing destination to invest in.' I thought: 'Wow! This will finally get rid of all that restrictive green tape that is making investments in minerals almost impossible.' I thought, 'Gee, they are going to bring in legislation that will get rid of green lawfare and vexatious claims that tie up projects for years.' And, as I mentioned, I thought there was the aspiration to get simpler industrial relations to enable productivity growth. But none of that is here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All the legislation does is turn the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation into Export Finance Australia. So, instead of helping develop markets and underwriting exporters who want to get on with producing products that the world needs, it has none of that. It just gives Export Finance Australia a whole tranche of money. It also changes the ARENA agency from research funding and seed funding for primary renewable products into funding for more renewable energy facilities as if there wasn't enough help already. They have been getting assistance for 20 years or more, and they still have all the in-built advantages of our restrictive electricity market rules, which favour renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aim is to put more money into doing things which are deemed to create lower greenhouse gas emissions, but this doesn't affect the major problem. For the ultimate low-carbon energy, we are proposing we unban it and get involved in it to make our energy clean. The legislation doesn't mention funding highly efficient, low-emission, new ultrasupercritical coal plants that would reduce our coal plants' footprints by 40 per cent. It doesn't allow investment in gas exploration, which the markets are crying out for in the southern and eastern states, where there are gas energy shortcomings identified by all market operators which are making electricity generation and all the things that has gas as a feedstock much more expensive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also removes restrictions on staffing in the Renewable Energy Agency and empowers the finance minister to cherry-pick which of these green schemes she is going to put money into. That amount of money is quite considerable—$22.7 billion between the 2025-26 budget year and the 2038-39 budget year. This is not going to do what those proposing it think it will do. We have heard ad infinitum about us becoming a green energy superpower and re-energising the manufacturing sector. But the reality of these renewable energy generation systems is that they make the system very, very expensive. The one-off build costs are cheap—and they would want to be cheap because they only work, on average, 20 to 30 per cent of the time—but they only last for 10 to 15 years. The batteries, concrete and steel—the stuff that goes into renewable energy—is incredibly expensive and has an ultra-short lifespan, whereas you can get 40, 50, 60 or 70 years out of a well-maintained coal plant, and you can get the same out of a nuclear energy plant. The standards of building them mean that they have a design life of at least 40 years. Most around the world are being extended to 60 years, and there are a couple that will be hitting the 80-year mark before they cease working. The new ones are built to an incredibly high standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would also like to point out is some of the details of this bill. As I mentioned, the Renewable Energy Agency will also be funding manufacturing. There are some technical things that will benefit the economy. There is the National Hydrogen Technology Skills Training Centre and a cooperative research centre. There is the strengthening of approvals for energy projects. I got excited when I saw that. But—hey presto—it's not going to speed up the approvals process for things like a new gas field or a new source of diesel or petrol that runs the country now and for generations to come. No, it's only going to speed up the approval of green processes or green energy systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rapid expansion of renewable energy across country Australia is quite scary at the moment. People are getting approvals in Queensland willy-nilly. People have mapped the footprint of this renewable energy superpower, and it is really quite destructive on the environment. In Queensland there is at least 600,000 hectares of remnant vegetation, or adjacent to national park high country, which is just going to be bulldozed for thousands of kilometres of access roads. It will destroy the flora and fauna in them, turning them into sterile wastelands. Koala habitats, wallabies—all those things that Australians see as our native jewels, both flora and fauna—are going to be excluded from those areas. The wind towers will use huge amounts of materials, and that's why their carbon footprint over their short lifespan makes them not as sustainable or green as they're advertised to be. They're actually quite destructive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's funding for green metals. I have just been to Korea and Japan. They are very keen for us to get hydrogen, but what they don't appreciate is us doing it by using renewable energy. We'll only be making it 20 to 35 per cent of the time depending on the vagaries of the weather. That is never going to be economical. If you think that expanding to have five or 10 times more renewable energy projects will guarantee permanent availability of energy, you are sadly misled. That is the whole premise of overbuilding all of these renewable energy projects. Unfortunately they're all highly correlated. That means they all stop at the same time and they all start at the same time, and that is dependent on the weather and the day-night cycle. Having a geographic spread and overbuilding installed capacity, as opposed to looking at what is going to generate cheap, reliable, available energy at the right voltage and frequency 24 hours a day—then we can talk about making green hydrogen or hydrogen economically.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">None of this is going to do that. It is very difficult to commercialise hydrogen production unless you have a lot of industrial heat and a lot of electricity. You also need to have a whole lot of water if you want to make it green. The Americans have worked out that the only way they can do that in a green sense is to have electrolysis and high heat coming from nuclear plants and just dedicate them full on to making green hydrogen. But hydrogen has a huge negative energy return on the energy invested. It will remain a critical industrial chemical for lots processes—we'll need it for rockets, missiles and all those sorts of things as well—but it's not going to be a major replacement for internal combustion engines. It will have a place in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in big cities, where they can be close to sources of cheap hydrogen, but I don't think it's going to replace the internal combustion engine. Putting all our eggs into a weather dependent system that we build from stuff made overseas is not going to re-industrialise the Australian industry base; it will just make our electricity more expensive, and we'll probably de-industrialise more and be left holding all these renewable energy projects with a short lifespan that will end up being abandoned and have to be replaced. In fact, the early windfarms that were put in in South Australia and Victoria are already coming up for replacement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to make things in Australia again, we need to get those fundamentals going again. That means getting the market rules which restrict our baseload operators from operating efficiently—market reform won't cost a cent; it will just mean that people who have cheap electrons will be able to get their electrons onto the grid so our prices will go down. We need to address this first up. We also need to make sure our coal plants aren't prematurely closed. Some of the 11 or 12 plants in Germany that were fired up as they got rid of their nuclear energy are now keeping their industry afloat, but their grid isn't as clean as it would have been if they'd kept their nuclear plants going. That's what we are doing now. Victoria is subsidising the coal plants because the market rules make them uneconomical. It's not because they need to close; it's just that they're losing money, so they need to be subsidised. It is the same in New South Wales. It's ironic that this allegedly cheapest form of energy has all these inbuilt subsidies. They get preference to get onto the grid. They get paid for the electricity at the top spot price, not their bid price. They also get a large payment for every kilowatt-hour that goes onto the grid. A renewable energy generator gets a large-generator certificate. If it's rooftop solar, they get a small-scale technology certificate. These are second income streams.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By all means, we can make things in Australia again, but we have to address the fundamentals. The thing that made us a manufacturer of aluminium and steel and allowed us to develop a car industry was that we had cheap energy that was available all the time because we utilised our own resources. That's what we should be focusing on. So, if you want to make Australia make things again, I wouldn't be supporting this. Look at things in a rational way. At the moment, a lot of these policies are made by political scientists, not by hard-nosed engineers. That's what we need. We need to bring engineers back, and then we'll get a sensible energy policy.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="298121" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SITOU</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  I have sat in on a number of these speeches because I did want to hear from the opposition about why they oppose the Future Made in Australia Bill. I am genuinely interested in their concerns and their objections to this bill. Let me read out some of the adjectives and other words that I have heard from those opposite: 'interventionist', 'command and control economy', 'market takeover', 'corporate welfare', 'socialist agenda' and, from the previous speaker, the member for Lyne, 'Orwellian' and 'utopian vision'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been an interesting study on their thoughts on this policy, because there is a policy that does meet all of those adjectives and other descriptors, and it's not the Future Made in Australia policy; it is their nuclear policy. If there is a policy that is interventionist, command and control, a market takeover and Orwellian—sure, they may think it's a 'utopian vision' to have more nuclear reactors in this country—that is the one policy that is being offered in this place that does meet all of those descriptors, because there is no private investment in nuclear energy in Australia. They know that, and that's why they know that the government will have to fund it completely. There is currently no nuclear energy industry here. So what they are proposing is a complete market takeover—complete government control to get their nuclear energy policy up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so surprised about their opposition to helping Australian companies and helping create more jobs here. It is clear that the only jobs they are willing to create are those in a nuclear industry in Australia, which is the only industry they're willing to back. It seems such a shame. If you look at their social media, they wrap themselves in the Australian flag, they talk about buying here in Australia and they talk about supporting Australian companies, and yet they refuse to back this bill, which is doing exactly that. The only industry that they're willing to back is the nuclear industry. So I've got some suggestions for those opposite. If you want to trademark a few company names, how about Nuclear Reactors R Us or CNR—Coalition Nuclear Reactors? These are some of the things that you may want to take forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that we on this side of the House genuinely back Australian companies outside the nuclear industry. Those opposite have offered up some suggestions for what might work in terms of industry policy and supporting Australian companies, but it's a bit hard to regard them as credible when we look at their track record. Economists and researchers at Harvard University have done a study into the economic complexities of countries around the world. While those opposite were in government, did our economy become more complex, diverse and rich? No. It became less complex. In the last decade alone, our economy became less complex, worsening by 12 positions in the global rankings. Countries around the world were trying to diversify their economies, increase advanced manufacturing, increase research and development, and support other sectors, but not this country—no. Those opposite refused to back manufacturing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now ranked 93 out of 133 countries, which puts us below Uganda and just above Pakistan in terms of economic complexity. Thanks to those opposite, we are the lowest ranked OECD country when it comes to economic complexity, and we have fallen 38 places since this index was created in 1995. That demonstrates that it doesn't have to be this way. The Atlas of Economic Complexity said, 'Australia's worsening complexity has been driven by a lack of diversification of exports,' and our economy is 'less complex than would be expected for its income level', given we had the ninth highest GDP per capita in 2021. This is because of those opposite refusing to back industry, refusing to back Australian manufacturing and refusing to back Australian companies. All that they've relied on is digging things out of the ground. And we are a country that is blessed with great resources, absolutely, but we've got to do more than dig things out of the ground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've just finished up with the Olympics and we've got the Paralympics coming up, so I'm going to use a sporting analogy here. Essentially, what those opposite did was try to create a team around one star player. In this case, our star player was resources and, of course, we had the Sam Kerr of resources—we had great iron ore and great critical minerals. But that was all they relied on—that one star player. If that star player gets injured or becomes sick, or we're playing another team where they're able to defend against that star player, we're stuffed. That's exactly what they did when they were in government; they stuffed us. We don't want to just dig resources out of the ground, ship them offshore, have other countries add value to them and then ship them back so we can use their final products. It's time we started to add value ourselves here on shore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why does this matter? It matters because we have seen that when you are not diversified and your economy is vulnerable to these big economic shocks it's the community that suffers. We have seen significant global financial disruptions: the COVID pandemic, the wars in the Ukraine and Gaza and supply chain constraints. We saw what happened during the pandemic when, because we had no real medical manufacturing onshore, we were scrambling to buy masks, scrambling to get RATs and scrambling to get vaccinations. To be fair to those opposite, their former leader did not think it was a race. He wanted to stroll into that, and try to get vaccines, and we paid the price. It was the community that paid the price for their lack of foresight in trying to build up an onshore manufacturing capability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We won't do what those opposite did. We know that we need to build resilience in our economy and that we need to diversify our economy, and this is exactly what the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 does. It is a plan to grow Australia's economic future and prosperity. It is a large, ambitious and bold plan, and it needs to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not alone in having industry policies. We've seen the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 in the US. There are industry policies in Japan and Korea. There are industry policies around the world. The only people who aren't backing an industry policy are those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's Future Made in Australia agenda announced in the last budget is about attracting and enabling investment, making Australia a renewable energy superpower, value-adding to our resources and strengthening economic security. It's about backing Australian ideas, innovation, digital and science ideas, and investing in people and places. This is an investment in Australian research, an investment in Australian manufacturing, and an investment in Australian companies and Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill establishes a framework to foster and encourage private sector investment in the national interest for a future made in Australia, by seizing the opportunities of the changing global environment. There are two primary objectives in this bill: to attract more private investment and to make our economy more resilient to shocks. We'll unlock private investment, ensure economic resilience and security in critical sectors and supply chains, and support early applications of nascent technologies critical to the net zero transformation. We'll create a positive investment environment and enable businesses to take appropriate risks. We'll create a National Interest Framework to support better alignment of economic incentives with our national interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Interest Framework consists of two streams: the net zero transformation stream to identify and support sectors that could have a sustained, comparative advantage in a net zero global economy; and where public investment is likely to be needed for the sector to make a significant contribution to emissions reduction at an efficient cost. The Economic Resilience and Security Stream is there to identify where some level of domestic capability in the sector is a necessary or efficient way to deliver economic resilience and security, and where the private sector will not deliver the necessary investment in the sector in the absence of government support. The National Interest Framework will support Australian government consideration and decision-making in relation to significant public investment that unlocks private investment at scale in the national interest. We can see that there are companies that are already using Australian minerals to manufacture solar panels to put on our roofs. Researchers are making breakthroughs in science that will lead to new medicines and new technologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Reid, in the suburb of Silverwater—which is an advanced manufacturing powerhouse—there are two star residence there: RODE Microphones and BluGlass, a semiconductor manufacturer. These are advanced manufacturing success stories. At the 2023 InnovationAus Awards for Excellence, BluGlass was named the Australian Hero for its development and commercialisation of a new semiconductor technology. The company is a wonderful example of converting Australian research success into Australian manufacturing success. The research behind BluGlass was developed at Macquarie University. It was after a decade of research that they had a breakthrough in innovative compound semiconductor technology that they were able to use to develop high-performance laser diodes. These visible lasers are used in critical and emerging technologies, including robotics, advanced materials manufacturing, defence technologies, and scientific and biomedical applications. The semiconductors BluGlass produces lead the world with their energy-efficient performance. How were they able to create this product? With private investment, yes, but also with government support through the research and development tax incentive along with government grants and early-stage revenue. It was through a combination of private investment, government tax incentive, government grants and support that this company was able to be created, which is exactly what the Future Made in Australia Bill is talking about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other example of manufacturing excellence in my electorate is RODE Microphones. This high-end audio equipment of choice for podcasters and influencers everywhere comes from an Australian-made company. Its metal components are manufactured onsite from materials sourced from Australia and overseas, and they export 97 per cent of their manufactured goods, largely to the US and Europe. When faced with fierce competition from a Chinese government-backed company on their bestselling product, RODE did not falter; instead, they innovated. In just 100 business days—a timeframe that would make most companies baulk—RODE went from concept to market with a new, superior product. This rapid response was possible only because RODE Microphones manufactures everything in-house, right here in Australia. RODE's founder Peter Freedman said: 'I just walk across the road and talk to the engineers. Two days later, we 're making it.' That's the sort of thinking that we want to be encouraging with this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  I'm pleased to rise to speak on the Future Made in Australia Bill and to follow the member for Reid, who has shared with us a remarkable collection of nonsequiturs and logical inconsistencies as she grasps around for some kind of argument in favour of what is, in fact, a naive piece of interventionist policy which is premised on the fundamentally false assumption that ministers and bureaucrats can do a better job of predicting what the market might be interested in paying for than private sector participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on the companies that she mentioned at the end of her speech. We all celebrate RODE, which is a remarkable Australian company that's built a global position in microphones and audio engineering. You could mention a range of other successful Australian companies that are manufacturing, exporting and building global scale and global market share. You could mention Cochlear, with the position they've built up in hearing implants over 30 or 40 years of sustained hard work based on research done in Australia, originally at the University of Melbourne, now based at the Hearing Hub at Macquarie University. You could mention CSL, which has similarly established a global position in particular market segments to do with plasma and other important elements of the medical value chain based on distinctive expertise and using that expertise to build a global market position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Or you could mention earlier stage companies. One that I would mention is Baraja, which, for a period of time, was based at CSIRO in West Lindfield in my electorate. The two PhD qualified men who founded it took the idea of dense wave division multiplexing, which is well known in telecommunications, and said, 'We think we could use this to come up with an innovative way of doing LiDAR.' LiDAR is the key component that is used in automated vehicles to sense the area through which the vehicle is driving. Their insight was that, if you split the light wave into all of the different colour components, you can get much richer data coming back to the sensor. That idea of splitting is fundamental to the way that dense wave division multiplexing works. Indeed, there's been a whole research tradition of this in Australia, with companies like Redfern Photonics, going back 30 or 40 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's be clear: nobody is contesting the proposition that it is a very good and desirable thing to have companies that take distinctive intellectual property developed in laboratories or universities in Australia and use that to build a global market position and employ thousands of people. Take CSL. They employ many thousands of people around the world. I think they operate in around 40 countries around the world. Nobody is contesting that that is a very good and desirable thing. What is being contested by this side of the House is the proposition that the best way to get to that outcome and generate more such companies and more prosperity, employ more people and build competitive positions in these intensely competitive sectors is to involve ministers and bureaucrats in developing things like Future Made in Australia plans, who are suddenly going to find new insights, new ways and new market opportunities that those dunderheads in the private sector had missed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a new idea. There is a long list of disastrous attempts to do this kind of thing in countries around the world. We laugh now at the idea of five-year plans setting out targets for the number of tractors to be built. That was a feature of the economy of the Soviet Union in the 1950s and 1960s. We laugh now because that seems like such a foolish idea. Of course, most of the countries of Eastern Europe have now moved away from that model. We can look at China, which moved away from that model and recognised that a market based approach was likely to be much more successful. But, if you look at what this government is essentially trying to do here, their big idea, their big breakthrough, is that somehow, by having ministers and bureaucrats here in Canberra come up with these ripper plans, they're going to attract more private-sector capital and a thousand flowers will bloom across sector after sector after sector where those hopeless dunderheads in private industry have failed to date to capture the opportunities. That shows a touching faith and, on any objective view, a naive faith in the capacity of bureaucrats and of governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposition that I want to put to the House this evening is that these are bad bills and bad policies that the opposition is opposing for three fundamental reasons. Firstly, whenever you have bureaucrats, officials and ministers making choices about where to put significant chunks of public money, there's a very good chance that money will get squandered and the outcomes for taxpayers will be dismal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I wanted to make is that we have, with the PsiQuantum episode that we've learnt quite a bit about over the last few months—none of it encouraging—a very good case study of exactly what can go wrong and how to take almost $1 billion of public money and, if I can put it politely, splash it up against the wall. My confident prediction to you is that the taxpayer is not likely to get anything like 100 cents on the dollar back on that almost $1 billion. There's every chance that almost all of it will disappear, with very little to be received in exchange.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third point I wanted to make, as many of my coalition colleagues have made very articulately and powerfully, is that there's a much better way to stimulate the economic and industrial activity and the growth that we all want to see—that is, by focusing on getting the basics right with cheaper energy prices and less complex, burdensome, expensive, difficult and non-globally-competitive industrial relations arrangements, as well as getting inflation under control so that businesses face lower operating costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's turn first to the proposition that, when you involve ministers and bureaucrats in setting out plans, you involve a lot of misallocated resources, a lot of wheel spinning and a lot of lengthy reports and plans being written by people who—I don't want to be rude—frankly have very little idea of what they're talking about. It is very evident in what is proposed here that there is real confusion about the roles of different bureaucratic entities. We're seeing an expansion of the role of ARENA, from research and development to, suddenly, manufacturing and deployment, where apparently their expertise has been hidden under a rock for 10 or more years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it's equally troubling that, in the way this has all been set up, the bill gives the Minister for Climate Change and Energy the capacity to allocate additional funding to CEFC at the stroke of a pen and that the government under this bill would be able to roll out almost $4 billion in an election year. So there's very little reason to be confident that this kind of top-down industrial policy is going to produce the targeted results. There's every reason to be confident that it will waste a lot of taxpayers' money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer is going to decide whether a particular sector of the Australian economy deserves investment. How likely is it that the Treasurer will have success in allocating capital? Capital allocation is one of the fundamental disciplines in business, and successful businesses get very good at it. They have real discipline in the way they do it, whether it is conglomerate-type businesses like Wesfarmers or, of course—one of the beloved examples for corporate finance theorists around the world—Berkshire Hathaway. Those capital allocation disciplines are critical to generating a return. The Treasurer is a fine fellow, but I'm sorry to say he has zero experience in this. So I say to Australian taxpayers: you can have zero confidence in the people who are going to be allocating the money that's being proposed to be spent here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn specifically, then, to a case study that is before us right now of what happens when a minister gets excited about a particular investment proposal. In this case, it is PsiQuantum, an American company—not an Australian company—based in Silicon Valley, in California. PsiQuantum came to Australia, knocking on the door, in 2022. They had a ripper proposal that the Australian government and one or more state governments should put hundreds of millions of dollars into building what they claimed was going to be the world's first fault tolerant, error corrected quantum computer, and Australia was going to get the very first chance to have one of those in specifically Queensland. The semiconductors contained in that computer won't be built in Australia because they are being built in Dresden in Germany and in New York state under agreements already signed by PsiQuantum with a company called GlobalFoundries. It's not as if the Australian government and the Queensland government are going to have any exclusivity here, actually, because just a few weeks ago the government of the US state of Illinois announced that they too are doing a deal with PsiQuantum to build a fault tolerant, error corrected computer. This one will go to Chicago. There are US$500 million available to subsidise that. So this agreement that the Australian government and the Queensland government have supposedly done with PsiQuantum doesn't secure any exclusivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are all the process problems. How were PsiQuantum chosen? Why were they the ones who happened to knock on the door of the minister? The minister has personally met with them on several occasions. He visited their premises in Silicon Valley. Why did they get this huge chunk of funding and a whole bunch of other quantum companies actually based in Australia and founded by Australians, companies like Silicon Quantum Computing, Diraq, Quantum Drilling or Q-CTRL, didn't get any of this? Indeed, why is it that the best they got was several months later when the government conducted an expression-of-interest process which on any analysis was a reverse-engineered sham, the rules of which said that participants were not allowed to speak to Australian government officials? Don't forget that PsiQuantum had been given the opportunity for months to speak with Australian government officials up to and including the minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what happens when ministers give to themselves or are granted the power to splash around hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. It gets spent in ways that do not reflect a disciplined or fair process. The consequence will be, I confidently predict, that this money which is being committed to PsiQuantum will not produce the kinds of returns that the minister has been suggesting. Here is another prediction. According to the minister, this computer is going to start operating in 2026. I confidently predict that that will not happen. No industry expert believes that that's going to be achieved by that date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My third proposition is that there is a much better way. If you want to encourage Australian companies to be innovative, to be successful and to export, create the business conditions which make it more attractive for private sector businesses and investments to allocate capital and to put capital at risk. Get inflation down by controlling government spending. Rather than changing the industrial relations rules so that the crooks and thugs at the CFMEU can knock on the door and—in fact, without even knocking on the door—march into workplaces all around Australia, reverse those disastrous changes. Make it easier to do business and impose fewer burdensome, costly and entirely globally uncompetitive industrial relations rules. Those are the basics. Then, of course, we need to get the cost of energy down. The cost of energy was promised to go down. It is going up and up. In business after business, that is creating huge problems for our global competitiveness. This fantasy notion that ministers and bureaucrats can pick winners that the private sector has missed is a recipe to waste a lot of taxpayer money. We on this side of the House are root and branch opposed to what is a very bad idea.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="298840" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  I'm glad the member for Bradfield has finished his speech, because my ears are hurting from all the predictions he made. Thank you for your predictions, but I'm sure Australia doesn't want to hear predictions; Australia wants to see something get done. And I rise today to speak in support of the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 and the Future Made in Australia (Omnibus Amendments No. 1) Bill 2024. This legislation aims to reshape our industrial landscape and secure a prosperous future for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think about this country in its glory days, one sector stands out above all others: the manufacturing sector. We were once a country that made things right here in Australia. We made the mighty Holden Commodore, when our car manufacturing industry was roaring. We produced vast amounts of steel at the BHP steelworks in Newcastle—and if you want to see some of that Newie steel, just look straight above us, because the flagpole is newie steel; that's from Newcastle, that steel. We even made socks and jocks in my electorate, in Cessnock, at the old Bonds factory. Manufacturing is a sector that Australians were proud of, and it often helped to form the identity of our working class towns. That's why Newcastle will always be known as a steel city. But, sadly, year after year, one by one, the businesses that made things here began to close. There are many different reasons for this, and I'm not going to point fingers, but the fact of the matter is that we became a country that just doesn't make things like we used to, and I think that's an absolute tragedy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately, this government is a government with a vision—a vision to bring back manufacturing to Australia, a vision to bring back our glory days. We want our future to be made right here. That's why we're investing in a Future Made in Australia, to unlock private investment in future industries and bring new jobs and opportunities to communities right across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in an exciting time right now. Plenty of opportunities are presenting themselves, and it's vital that we as a country are placed in a position where we are able to make the most of these opportunities. The world is moving towards net zero; there's no doubt about that. This means there are tonnes of opportunities to make the most of the economic and industrial benefits that are coming. This bill is about positioning us to develop the technology and the products that will not only power our own future but also play a big part in the future of countries all around the world, ensuring that it is our industry and economy that benefit from the changes that are occurring globally. This bill will help Australia build a stronger, more diversified and more resilient economy powered by renewable energy and other technologies of the future. It will create more secure, well-paid jobs and encourage and facilitate the private sector investment required to make Australia an indispensable part of the global net zero economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know about those who sit opposite, but I will never say no to or stand in the way of something that brings well-paid and secure jobs to Australia in the future and now. If we can encourage the private sector to invest and bring these jobs here, then we absolutely should. If you're going to succeed in anything, you need to know your strengths and make the most of them. Our strengths are in our industrial resources, skills and energy base, and our attractiveness as an investment destination. We would be crazy not to make the most of these strengths by building our future here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill recognises this reality and recognises that if our industry and our economy are to grow it will be on the back of our strengths. We already have an advantage in new sectors like renewable energy. We have a lot of land, we are a sunny country and we have lots of places where it's extremely windy. We need to combine this advantage with our traditional strengths in resources and manufacturing to build new opportunities, including in critical minerals processing, green metals, clean energy technologies, and low-carbon liquid fuels. Luckily for our industry and our economy, the bill and the omnibus bill deliver on key elements of the government's Future Made in Australia plan announced on the 2024-25 budget. They'll help to deliver our plan by imposing rigour on government decision-making and providing investors with the clarity and certainty to invest and unlock growth in our economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also provides the framework and specific initiatives to mobilise the private capital we need to make the most of shifts in the global economy. As the Prime Minister has repeatedly outlined, the Hunter will play a huge role in achieving this ambition. Ahead of us lie big nation-building and region-building endeavours that can propel us forward. With the backing of the $22 billion Future Made in Australia fund, it is a great time for regions, especially regions like mine, where we've been manufacturing and building things for a long time and plan to do so well into the future. By making the most of this transition, we are creating safe, secure jobs for our workers to move into as our traditional industries start to change over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike some of those opposite, who just play dress-up and pretend to understand the needs of the regions, Labor has a real vision to keep regional Australia booming. We won't hold back on making the most of the opportunities of the future. Unlike those opposite, our vision is not pie-in-the-sky nuclear power plants that wouldn't be here in the next 20 years even if they had it their way. Our vision is backed by real action on the ground, real funding, real programs and real jobs right now. That's what the Labor government's Future Made in Australia plan is all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This boom is especially good for regional Australia, electorates like mine in the Hunter and electorates like Paterson, Newcastle and Shortland as well. Those areas really do need this. In the Hunter we are building on our strengths with our manufacturing background and strong skill base. We are in the heart of many great industries in the Hunter, and the $23 billion Future Made in Australia package will ensure we are the heart of many great industries for generations to come. Our success in the Hunter will be Australia's success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Take Ampcontrol, a great company based in our region, with two workshops in the Hunter. This company is building innovative electric products that are cleaner and more reliable than the ageing products they are replacing. They have jumped on the opportunities the clean energy transition is creating and, in doing so, they are manufacturing in the Hunter, creating safe, secure and well-paid jobs. The products are cutting edge and not just being used in Australia but also being exported overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also announced we will be building world-class solar panels on the sites of decommissioned power stations like at Liddell.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the world changes and industry changes, workers feel a sense of uncertainty, but, by establishing new industries with well-paid, secure jobs, workers can see the direction that we're heading in the future and they will have the certainty they need to be able to embrace it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are very specific kinds of investment that we want this bill to drive. We want investments that promote safe and secure jobs that are well paid and have great conditions. We want investments to develop more skilled and inclusive workforces, including by investing in training and skills development and broadening opportunities for workplace participation. We also want investments that encourage and work together to achieve positive outcomes for local communities such as First Nations communities and communities directly affected by the transition to net zero. We also want investments that strengthen domestic industrial capabilities, including through stronger local supply chains that demonstrate transparency and compliance in relation to the management of their tax affairs, including benefits received under Future Made in Australia supports. If we have people or companies making investments that tick all of these boxes, we will be well placed to build a future here and make the most of the challenges that will come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, the Future Made in Australia Bill will do three critical things. It empowers the government's new National Interest Framework to identify where we have a genuine advantage over other countries as we transition to net zero economy. This ensures that we enter this new economy on the strongest foot possible, playing to our strengths. It establishes a robust sector assessment process to help improve understanding of how government can best leverage private investment in areas of the economy aligned with the framework and help inform rigorous government decision-making. It defines a set of community benefit principles to ensure that the benefits of the Future Made in Australia support, and the private sector investment it enables, flow to local communities, workers and businesses. We need this bill for our country to grow and our economy to boom in years to come. This bill is good for industry, good for our economy and good for jobs. It's a win for all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to continue a little bit now that I've finished the main part of my speech. I've heard a lot of people talk in this chamber, and I talk to thousands of people in the Hunter regularly. They tell me that they want to see us work together. They want to see both sides of this place and the crossbench work together so that we can make Australia a better place. Unfortunately, those opposite us here—some of them, many of them, if not all of them—are just saying no for the sake of saying no, and that's an absolute disgrace. This is $23 billion to go towards manufacturing in this country that those opposite are saying no to—that is absolutely terrible for the people of Australia. It shows those opposite have no faith in manufacturing for us in this country, while we on this side of the chamber know that that $23 billion will be spent very well. It will be spent on the right things to get manufacturing back in this country so that, hopefully, we can make socks and jocks back in Cessnock again. Hopefully, we can see so much other manufacturing happen: steel, and so many other things that can happen in the Hunter and Patterson and so many other places as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure that in the next 12 months or so those opposite, when we go to an election, will try to use a speech like this against me into the future. What I want to say to the people of the Hunter is: while people want to buy our coal, we will always supply them that coal. We will always supply the export market. That is what Labor will do and that is what I will always fight for. That is what the member for Paterson will always fight for, that's what the member for Shortland will always fight for, and that is what the member for Newcastle will always fight for. Please just remember that when we do go to an election, because this will definitely come up. What I really hope is that those opposite stop saying no to everything that we put forward when we are trying to make Australia better. I really hope that we can work together—most Australians want us to work together—to try to make Australia a better place. Please, let's just work together and put our differences aside with politics. I know we have a little joke here and there, and I understand that, but we need to make sure we're doing the best for Australia. Let's work together and actually do that, because I guarantee we will have a lot more respect from the people of the Hunter and the people of the rest of Australia as well.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LLEW O'BRIEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:07</span>):  I rise to speak on the Future Made in Australia Bill. I did listen carefully to the member for Hunter over there. He's a good bloke. He is a good bloke and we should try to work together. We do work together a lot in this place. I think the general public wouldn't understand how much we work together. They see the contest and us getting stuck into each other and they think that's all that happens here, but in the vast majority of work we do, we work together. I'm on a committee with the member for Hunter, and we work together well but, sorry mate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak on this bill, and to speak in opposition of this bill and the policy in general. It does come with a fantastic name—I'll give it that. You'd fall in love with the name very easily—the Future Made in Australia Bill—and I think that's what the Labor Party marketing people had in mind when they concocted it, but it's unfortunate that it doesn't actually correlate with the content of the bill. It is a bill that is designed to expand the role of the Export Finance Australia and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, and establish a National Interest Framework that retrospectively underpins the government's Future Made in Australia policy. That sounds wonderful. I had a good read of the explanatory memorandum, and some of the bill, and I can say that I totally disagree with the premise here—that is that we're going to be creating manufacturing jobs by subsidising businesses that are not profitable or viable in the hope that one day they will be. In that explanatory memorandum there were a few things that jumped out at me. One of them was the phrase 'the green premium'—that's the extra money you have to pay for some of these technologies that can't be produced at the same price as with conventional methods now. I don't remember the green premium being mentioned before the last election by the Prime Minister. I suspect that the Australian punter, when they find out what the green premium is, will run away from it very quickly because if they think the cost-of-living crisis that they're in now is bad, it's going nowhere with your green premium. It's around to stay, and we will all be paying extra for this absolute fantasy that the Labor Party is involving Australians in with their extraordinarily damaging rush to 70 per cent renewables by 2030. It's really quite frightening. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We already manufacture a lot of good things in Australia, including in my electorate of Wide Bay. Indeed, under the regional growth fund the coalition had we supported business. We put out an expression of interest call for all businesses and all ideas that might be viable and create jobs in the regions to come forward and put their business case in and show us how they could develop with a bit of support and be viable straightaway. One of the great success stories was Rheinmetall NIOA which is now making high-tech 150 millimetre munitions shells that are being purchased all around the world. They've created a hundred jobs in Maryborough. That's what you need to do. You need to look at things and apply general, normal, competent economic standards and say, 'That's a winner and that's going to create jobs so let's invest in it.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this policy does is pick the winners based on an ideology, and on big government and on government telling businesses what they need to make, even though they are unviable, and subsidising it with taxpayers' money to the tune of something like $22 billion. This policy is going to effectively waste $22 billion in an international market where we trade with other economies. This is just pie in the sky. It is complete and utter pie in the sky.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What adds insult to injury is that this is happening in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, when people are finding it difficult to pay their general bills. They've really got to think about how they're going to put those dollars together to afford to send the kids on an excursion or even to let the kids have food from the tuckshop a couple of times a week if that's what they want. They really have to think about it. The government is not focused on fixing those problems; they're focused on this ideological mission that is going to harm us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that our current inflation crisis, which is seeing us at the very back of the G10 nations in terms of recovering from anything that could be blamed on COVID, is quite extraordinary. It's homegrown. Even the Governor of the Reserve Bank has clearly articulated this is a spending problem and it is homegrown. You can only blame Vladimir Putin for so long. Under Labor we've seen extraordinary increases in prices for families and for businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People are paying more income tax. The level of income tax is up by 20 per cent. Real wages for employees have actually collapsed in this time, while Labor's policies have forced prices up. It really is the stuff of nightmares.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is so taken up by its ideological mission to decarbonise Australia with 58 million solar panels and thousands and thousands of wind turbines that they've forgotten the job at hand, which is actually getting the settings right so Australian families can afford to live. They can spruik on as much as they like about subsidising high electricity prices, but you've got to create the fundamentals, create the environment, where those prices aren't high, and that's what they are not doing. They're having the opposite effect. Their policies are driving prices up; electricity prices are up by 20 per cent. The government are completely and utterly neglecting the primary job of a government, which is looking after Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other element to this is, what could we do to help businesses? What could we do without this interventionist, big government approach that the Albanese government has taken on? The first thing we could do would be to work on bringing electricity prices down, not subsidising them. We need to work on bringing them down because it's not only families but also businesses that are paying some of the highest electricity prices in Australia, and that is a big disincentive for people setting up in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing we have traditionally benefited from in Australia has been cheap and consistent electricity. Well, that's what we need. That needs to be the first order of priority, not decarbonising. We need to look at how we can extend the life of our coal-fired power, how we can get more gas into the system and use those traditional methods of providing electricity to industry and families to make sure that we're strong up until the time when we transition to a reliable emissions-free nuclear, if emissions-free is what the people want. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we don't get these settings right, if we don't get it so as we can provide the confidence and cheap electricity for business, we're going to see more foreclosures. We're going to see insolvencies continue at a rate that we already have. Since Labor came to power, 19,000 businesses have become insolvent. That's the highest number since ASIC began collecting data. This tells a story. We've got an inflation crisis that is caused by government spending. This bill seeks to spend more money. This inflation crisis is hurting Australians, with the cost-of-living crisis and with interest rates and the cost of living generally going up, and this government is not addressing that. It is ideological madness to continue going down this path that will hurt Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting back to the point that my friend the member for Hunter made about cooperation, this bill has not been criticised by only the coalition. This isn't just the coalition coming in and trying to take the bill apart. People in industry, government officials and bureaucrats from Treasury have warned against this. The Productivity Commission also has not only criticised the program but has warned that some of the already announced programs, such as those that deal with making solar panels and the PsiQuantum project announced by the government, should be subject to a stricter national interest test. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How this national interest test or this framework will actually apply is a little bit vague, really, and that brings me to the next point against this bill, which is that this is just an absolute opportunity for pork-barrelling and an abuse of public funds by a minister. These very vague terms give a minister the opportunity to write a cheque for up to nearly $4 billion in an election term where they want, when they want and how they want. That's not good. I heard the member for Indi, who sits on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Anti-Corruption Commission with me and the member for Menzies, highlight some concerns about that and about the way that will be applied, and I share her concerns. This is not a policy that withstands rigorous scrutiny at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need to do is ensure that we are bringing inflation down. We need to stop the mindless overspending of taxpayers' money—that's what we need to do first. We can do that by knocking on the head the absolutely mad policies, like providing tax credits—billions of dollars—to billionaires. That would be a good starting point. We also need to stop the red and green tape and the overregulation that this Albanese government has inflicted upon business, so that business can get about doing what they do rather than having to comply with all sorts of crazy environmental and bureaucratic red tape. We need to invest in and encourage our gas and mineral industries, which have been great industries in helping to build our nation. We need to fix the industrial relations system that the Labor Party have inflicted upon business. We heard the member who spoke before me speak about the ability of the CFMEU to come into workplaces around the country on demand, for no reason, even if there are no members. They're the sorts of things we need to fix. We need to give small businesses—the 2.5 million small businesses—a clear definition of what a casual worker is. That'd be a great start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill fails at every level. This bill is big government, it is about subsidising industries that are not viable, and it's a complete and utter waste of taxpayers' money.</span>

                    <a href="300130" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  I rise to make a contribution on the extremely important Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 and Future Made in Australia (Omnibus Amendments No. 1) Bill 2024. A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit VEEM, a company with headquarters in Canning Vale in my electorate of Tangney. VEEM designs and manufactures high-technology marine propulsion and stabilisation systems for industry, including the defence industry. It was my absolute pleasure to welcome and host the Hon. Richard Marles on a visit to VEEM's headquarters, where we had the opportunity to learn about the company's commitment to innovation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With cutting-edge technology and a state-of-the-art facility right in the heart of Tangney, VEEM is a great Tangney success story. And, with AUKUS opening global supply chain opportunities to Australian companies, VEEM is one example of how the Albanese Labor government is creating jobs and opportunities while supporting local businesses. I saw how VEEM prioritised research and development to meet the evolving needs of the defence, marine and aerospace industries. The local manufacturing industry has well-paid jobs and leading technology. It was wonderful to see, and it made me incredibly proud to be their representative. Half of what VEEM produces is exported around the world. This is an example of what Tangney and what Australia is and can do for the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tangney alone there are many factories and many local businesses with hardworking, highly skilled and talented professionals who are making the most of our resources and potential to manufacture for Australia and for the world. We have high-tech companies that are making advances for the world. We have skills and innovation that I am happy to see in Tangney and that I am proud to champion and advocate for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's Future Made in Australia plan is about making things in Australia. It is about maximising the economic and industrial benefits of the global transformation to net zero and ensuring Australia's place is secure and valued as part of the global economy and strategic landscape. This plan is a positive vision for a bright future, and one where the Australian economy is more secure, more diversified and more resilient. A future powered by renewable energy—with Australia as a renewable energy superpower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will help Australia build a stronger, more diversified and more resilient economy that is powered by renewable energy. It will create more secure, well-paid jobs. It is about encouraging and facilitating the private sector investment required to make Australia an indispensable part of the global net zero economy. This bill is about seizing the opportunity that we have now to ensure that we all have a better future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government understands the need for a technology-led, skilled and sustainable manufacturing industry so that we can fully participate in global markets for clean energy. By making things here and by adding value here, we have an opportunity to secure jobs for this generation and for more generations to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my community of Tangney, many of my constituents ask me about our competitiveness. Because the people of Tangney are so diverse, many of my constituents bring a global lens to our conversations. They see a global environment that is changing and changing fast. They are worried about how we can compete. They want to know how we will make our economy more secure. They ask about job opportunities and if they will be skilled and well-paid. They look at their children and they see the future and ask me what we are doing to make sure that people have the skills they need to succeed. We do not want to be left behind because it is not only about the opportunity, there is also an urgency. The time is now, so let's get it done. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I lived in Malaysia I knew Australia to be famous for many of the products that it is still well-known and still well-respected for today. But today—now and for our future—we cannot just continue to rely on the same extracting and the same exporting that we have done before. For our future prosperity we need a vision, we need to be forward thinking and we need to add value.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be part of a government that not only has a vision for our future but is taking action to deliver it. We need to take the traditional strengths we have in resources and manufacturing to build new opportunities, including in critical mineral processing, green metals, clean energy technologies and also in low carbon fuels. With the resources we have, we stand to have a great advantage so we can create things that the world will want from us. Australians are full of good ideas and innovation, and this is about realising opportunity from our natural advantages. Our future growth prospects lie at an intersection of our industrial, resources, skill and energy bases, and how attractive we are for investment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak in support of Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 and the Future Made in Australia (Omnibus Amendments No. 1) Bill 2024. These bills impose rigour on government decision-making and help give investors the clarity and certainty they need to invest and unlock growth in our economy. We want to attract and mobilise more investment. The National Interest Framework in the Future Made in Australia Bill will help identify where Australia has a genuine comparative advantage in the net zero economy, where we have economic security and resilient imperative. This is a smart and considered framework, and this legislation also establishes a robust sector assessment process to help improve understanding of how government can best leverage private investment in the area of economy aligned with the framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My Labor colleagues and I all want to see communities across Australia benefit from a future made in Australia. This bill defines a set of important community benefit principles so that public and private investment will support and strengthen our communities. Hand-in-hand is the focus on skill, training and education, because public education is a big part of our future. For our future prosperity, we need to ensure that Australia has the skilled labour force in the area of need so that we can achieve our Future Made in Australia ambitions. This plan is focused on closing the gap in key areas of skill shortages, with new places at university and TAFE, an investment in the clean energy workforce and skills areas that lead to better, well-paid jobs in good conditions and that better benefit our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Australia has a central and vital role to play as part of the Future Made in Australia. Western Australia has a lot to offer: WA resources, minerals and metals, WA institutions and Western Australians themselves, including our workers and businesses. WA is full of ideas. Our universities and bright minds are focused on the latest research. Our skilled workforce has impressive knowledge from geology to robotics, and those skills continued to grow. The demand for those skills continues to grow as well. It grows because, as industry and the global landscape changes, Western Australia adapts alongside them. The resources industry has long been a major part of the WA economy, and it has made significant achievement because of the industry's ability to evolve and to never stay still. WA invests in clean energy. The state champions cutting-edge technology to help maximise potential opportunities, and it is ready for opportunities that may present themselves in the future. WA embraces innovation and the productivity gains that come along with it—just like we need to continue to do with the Future Made in Australia plan. Western Australia is a key part of the success of the Future Made in Australia plan, and our experience, skills and ideas will be needed as we explore new opportunities, seek out new investment and engage with global markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to speak in support of this bill that is part of the government's $22.7 billion Future Made in Australia budget package, which includes production tax incentives for hydrogen and critical minerals, the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund, the Solar Sunshot program, the Battery Breakthrough Initiative, the National Interest Account and other initiatives to better attract and enable investment and make Australia an indispensable part of global supply chains, like VEEM and their propeller made of bronze and their gyro stabiliser in Tangney, which is one of the most advanced commercial facilities in the world, and other manufacturers and businesses in Tangney whose highly technical products are key parts of the global supply chains. Strengthening supply chains and ensuring that our talented people and their great ideas stay here—this is what this legislation is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Science and research technology are all at the forefront of a future made in Australia. And, just like a future made in Australia, it's not only one thing, one person or one industry. We all have a role to play in delivering this future—our future, made in Australia. I have been inspired to hear about the different local businesses across Tangney and learn about their work and the products that they export all over the world. I have been equally inspired by people in Tangney who are studying in these areas, people who are developing the skills we need in key areas and preparing for the future. Our government's investment in education, skills and training is so critical, as is, of course, the people who are developing the big ideas that can change the world. In my conversations with scientists, investors, small business owners, students and young people, I see so many people in Tangney with great ideas. A future made in Australia helps to back Australian innovation and science as well as the talents of our people. There is so much talent, skill and potential, and we cannot be afraid to have the necessary ambition to realise this potential. This plan is ambitious. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWN" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024, and I'll state from the outset that I am opposed to this bill. I've been listening to the speeches, particularly on the other side, and sometimes I think I'm in a high school debating club where you can signal your virtue and talk about wonderful things. The previous speaker, the member for Tangney, talked about high-paid jobs. I'm just wondering how that works when you take an operator off a D10 bulldozer because you've closed down their mine and you give them a bottle of Windex and a soft cloth to wipe the dust off solar panels. How does that actually work?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard other members blame the coalition for the Holdens and the rest of the car industry leaving Australia. Would they keep subsidising it? The reason that Ford and Holden left Australia is that they made a product that no-one wanted to buy. We didn't lose the Kingswoods and the Falcons; we lost a large family sedan that was too low slung to go on a country road and too big for the city. A lot of people come to me and complain about the loss of Holden and Ford. When you ask them what they're driving, they say, 'Oh, it's a Hilux,' or something. So the Australian people made the decision about Holden and Ford leaving Australia. Following on from the speeches from the Labor Party, we would probably continue to be subsidising them to make something that they don't really want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous member spoke about universities and getting the skills to undertake this new industry that we're going to have in our renewable powerhouse. I'm not sure what university course teaches you how to use a pop riveter, but that's the sort of skill you would need in a factory bolting together solar panels. I'm wondering where this workforce is going to come from. One of the reasons that manufacturing has moved offshore is the scarcity of labour. The industrial relations laws in this country have made it incredibly difficult. With the implementation of the IR agenda of this government now, small business has a huge disincentive to actually increase, because, once they get to 15 employees, they've got to have an on-site union organiser and open access to total strangers carrying the union card to influence their businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Reid made a very thoughtful contribution about the wonderful businesses that she's proud of in her electorate, and that's great, but they were done without this policy. That's the point. A lot of the Labor Party have shot themselves in the foot as they are spruiking how innovative their electorates are without this policy, so I'm not quite sure how that would go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are advantages—or disadvantages—to being in here for a long time. I was here when the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government came in. The day that they announced their climate change policy, Kandos, which was then in my electorate—it's not now; it's in Calare—closed the cement plant. So these innovative renewable projects that we're going to produce here are going to be stuck in the ground with cement that comes on a ship from Asia because the policies we put in place here have made it impossible to be competitive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is a history lesson, folks: there are two things that made this country as great as it is. They are our ability to produce more food than we need and our ability to have cheap energy. I represent people that work in both of those sectors, and they are under constant attack day after day after day just to keep doing the things they do to keep this country viable. We have green protesters gluing themselves to the railway line at Newcastle because they are opposed to coal exports. At the same time, my grain and cotton producers can't get their trains to port. They miss the shipping deadline, causing enormous harm. What's worse, the ANZ bank have removed their funding for the Port of Newcastle to show their virtue to their customers and shareholders. It's the biggest exporting terminal that services my electorate, with potential to go into containers and other things. The disconnect we are seeing between people showing their virtue and what's practically possible here is actually mind-blowing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Day after day after day, we talk about being a renewable energy powerhouse. Who in here knows that, for 43 minutes of every day, all the electricity generated in Japan comes from Narrabri? Who knows that? Do you know why? It's because it's low in sulphur and it's low in ash. Through the Healy power stations they're getting emissions similar to gas. But we're going to close that down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're talking here about lifting Indigenous people out of poverty. Who here knows that 250 Aboriginal people work in that mine at Narrabri and are earning $120,000 or $140,000 a year operating equipment there? They're going to rip that up. Who here knows that the Murray-Darling Basin, the food and fibre bowl of this country, now is under constant attack to remove our productivity so people elsewhere can feel good about themselves because they're protecting the environment? What's the biggest employer of Aboriginal people in my electorate after mining? It's water. So we're taking those jobs out. We'll be buying fruit from China, where there are none of the conditions that we have here. So this virtue signalling without any practical understanding of what it means is a huge issue for us here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The actual powerhouse of our economy is not big business. It's smaller, innovative business. We've seen a few big corporate flyers circulating the halls of parliament with their hi-vis names on their vests, talking about hydrogen and things like that. Well, they're backing off that a bit now, aren't they? Where are the innovative small businesses?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A few months ago I was at the Ahrens factory in Gilgandra. They're producing grain silos. There's a lot of talk here about resilience. There is nothing that's going to make the ag sector more resilient than the ability to store grain and sell it when the market suits or store it as fodder for drought. The previous government had, in one year, 100 per cent instant asset write-off for preparation, for grain storage, for water and for infrastructure. There was an absolute boom in manufacturing in regional areas. The Ahrens factory at Gilgandra employs a large number of Indigenous people in highly paid, highly skilled jobs, but they say, 'No, we do away with that policy.' The instant asset write-off meant that farmers could purchase planters made in the member for New England's electorate, up at BOSS Engineering—a magnificent Australian success story. They are the absolute Rolls Royce of farm machinery. They could buy a planter and get that off their tax in one year, but, no, not now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we talk about ways of reducing our emissions. Inland Rail: one train from Melbourne to Brisbane takes 150 trucks off the road. How much is that saving on our carbon emissions? These factories that we're going to have in our capital cities will be producing all this stuff that's going to be shunted all over the place, so wouldn't it be good if we had an efficient, low-energy way of transporting that around, like Inland Rail? Wouldn't it be really good to have that? 'No, no, no. We're going to put a hold on that for God only knows how long.' God help you if you want to take a photo next to Inland Rail. Next thing you know the Senate is trying to pin you for trespassing. That's the level we've gotten to in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Martinus, an Australian company, have developed this track-laying machine that can do a couple of kilometres of track a day. Where is it now? It is sitting collecting dust somewhere because that project has come to a halt. So how about in this country we stick to our knitting? How about we back those that know what they're doing and are doing a good job?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't subsidise something that we feel is philosophically important. That's the divide in this place now. Are the children of the members from the leafy suburbs or the teal seats going to go and bolt solar panels together, or is it their aspiration to say, 'We've saved the environment because we've subsidised a factory somewhere out in the suburbs where we don't have to look at it, but we really feel good about what we're doing for the environment'?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a classic example of where Labor just don't get it. My home town used to be a Labor town, with council workers, shearers, railway workers, timber workers and coalminers. All those people have left Labor. We've got copper and we've got gold. You don't think a bit of gold, silver, silicon or glass gets used in some of these solar panels? How are we going to make these things if we don't have the mines to mine them? Where's the energy going to come from to drive these factories? We're producing solar panels to generate energy so we can produce more solar panels, but where's the net gain to the country? What about the 20 million people outside Australia who rely on us to feed them? What's going to happen to them? We've got vegetation laws that are coming in because apparently growing crops is unseemly. The attack on our cattle is next. We've already seen the sheep industry devastated. Like those over there, I am very proud of my electorate for their innovation, their hard work and what they do. Why is it that they have to fight every day for their very existence?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So while all this sounds really good—and there was a bit of talk in Dubbo earlier this year about the hydrogen that's going to be produced there by a ship that comes around from Western Australia into Port Kembla and pumps it into the system and produces hydrogen in Dubbo. I'm not sure that I'm going to see that. Why don't we just back what Dubbo does well? The previous government put $10 million into the Bourke Shire Council to put in the infrastructure for a small animals abattoir. My goodness, fancy doing that! Guess what? In Bourke—they're probably about 70 or 80 per cent Indigenous—there are 150 jobs that weren't there five years ago. We're actually supplying food, and that's largely going to Muslim communities all over the world because of their fondness for goatmeat. That is a practical government investment that employs people, provides something that's actually needed and is not virtue signalling so that we can say at the next election: 'We're cooling the climate. We're going to build solar panels in Australia at three times the cost of China and hope someone wants to buy them.' I oppose this bill and I certainly hope that those in the Senate decide to do the same.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="LTU" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care</span> and Assistant Minister for Indigenous Health) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:52</span>):  Having been a member of this House for six years, I've seen my fair share of legislation pass. There's been some great work done in my six years here: legislation to support 10 days of paid domestic and family violence leave, which is something that I was particularly proud of, legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs and legislation to establish the Net Zero Economy Authority, just to name a few. But, like many of us, my own engagement in politics and advocacy extends beyond my six years here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent the best part of a decade as the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and, before that, I headed the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, this country's largest union with now around 350,000 members. Throughout my time working with the ACTU, with the ANMF or as a nurse before that, I was always involved in fighting for a fairer Australia and a more just world. It's a pursuit which many have taken up before me and, of course, many will take up after me, because political and social change never exist in isolation. They build off generations before you and have the potential to impact generations after.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be able to make this change on the streets or in this House, you need to have an eye towards history. It's my view that every piece of legislation we consider in this place must be viewed within the broad sweep of history. To be able to make effective policy today, you learn from the past—from past mistakes and successes. And, as an elected representative, you must have an eye towards the generations to come. How will your policy impact future generations in 2040, 2060 or 2080? It is within this broader framework that I wholeheartedly speak to support the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 and commend the Treasurer, the Minister for Industry and Science, the Prime Minister and the entire Labor government for its work in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 20th century, in many ways, was a golden age for Australian jobs and manufacturing. The governments of Chifley and Curtin played a key role in supporting our nation's reconstruction in the post-war period. The role of the state, aided and abetted by foreign investment, supported a healthy economy and a strong jobs market, an economy where things were made right here in Australia. It was an era of secure employment and decent wages and one where the fruits of our collective labour were shared equitably. The flow-on effects of the federal government's industry policy helped build our nation both literally in the infrastructure it produced and also its population. The flow-on effects of our strong economy contributed to the creation of things like the PBS, our public education system and our strong social safety net.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in the 1980s, we saw a change in our attitude to making things in this country. The government in those years—a Labor government, I might add—did foresee the negative impacts of deregulation. That government attempted to soften any of those changes that might have affected particularly workers with the advent of the social wage—Medicare, superannuation and protected bargaining. The global shift towards neoliberalisation, with its relentless pursuit of deregulation, privatisation and the dismantling of protections for workers, decimated our capacity to manufacture in Australia under the Howard years. It was a global trend, but it did actually peak under the Howard government when we saw the closure of countless factories, the offshoring of jobs and the erosion of our industrial base.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up in working-class Richmond in Melbourne. It was a hive of manufacturing activity. We had shoe factories. We had textile and clothing factories. Skipping Girl Vinegar was there, and that wonderful and famous neon sign is still glowing to remind us of the glorious past. Vickers Ruwolt was just up the road from where I lived, making massive machinery for other industries. There were bakers, chocolate factories, soccer factories and shirt factories. Everywhere you went, there were factories around where I lived. That's all gone. It's all disappeared. For years and years, those factories stood there like ghosts. Now, they are gorgeous apartments. The whole suburb has changed with gentrification.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But once a pillar of our economy and a source of secure employment for many people, manufacturing was left to wither under the false promise that the market alone would provide. The result has been the hollowing out of communities, the loss of skilled jobs and a growing dependence on imports. It's left our economy vulnerable and our sovereign capability weak. Sovereign capability refers to a nation's capacity to independently produce and sustain the critical goods and services necessary for its security and wellbeing. It's about having the resilience to meet our needs, especially in times of crisis. According to the OECD, Australia was ranked last on manufacturing self-sufficiency compared to other member countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 pandemic shone a harsh spotlight on how the loss of our manufacturing abilities from decades of neoliberal policies exposed the vulnerabilities in our sovereign capability. In 2020, as borders began to shut and supply chains slowed, we as a nation experienced shortages of medical supplies such as masks, vaccines and PPE. It quickly became evident that the offshoring of manufacturing had left us precariously dependent on global supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to pause for a minute to talk about something else that happened over the last few decades. That is climate change, a topic that is very important to members of my community of Cooper. There is now scientific consensus that emissions from human activity are contributing to a changing climate. Despite many of those on the other side having their heads in the sand, it's not hard to see scorching heat across our summer, tropical diseases heading southward and a longer bushfire season. From north to south and from east to west, we're seeing extreme weather events just about every single week: floods, fire tornadoes and drought. Labor listens to the experts and understands the need to transition our economy away from one that relies on fossil fuels to one that is clean, green and energy efficient. Australia is actually ideally placed to benefit from the global transition to net zero due to our comparative advantages, capabilities and trade partnerships. There is a role for government to create a positive environment for investment, and the private sector is responding, but the government needs to do more. Did those opposite do this when they were in government? No. They could barely land an energy policy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is within this historical context—the loss of manufacturing, the loss of sovereign capability, delays in climate action and the opportunity to become a clean energy superpower—that the Labor government puts forward an option to the Australian people, an option for change. It is an option for stability and sustainability over a decade of climate denial and failed energy policies. It is an option for sovereignty and capability over a mismanaged COVID response. It is the option for a future made in Australia over the option of zero industry policy. It is the option of the Albanese Labor government over the Morrison-Turnbull-Abbott failure. In May 2022 the Australian people made their choice. They chose a future made here. They chose action on climate change. They chose investment in renewables. They chose jobs in manufacturing. They chose a Labor government, the Albanese Labor government. Today that government is delivering on those commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 is truly a landmark piece of legislation, one that takes into account the historical context and present-day challenges that I've described while also setting up our country for generations to come. This is a piece of legislation that combines action on climate change, support for working people, investment in communities and security in our manufacturing and energy supply. It is legislation that maximises the economic and industrial benefits of the global transformation to net zero and secures Australia's place in a changing global, economic and strategic landscape. It recognises that our future growth prospects lie at the intersection of our industrial, resource, skills and energy bases, and our attractiveness as an investment destination. It combines our comparative advantages in renewable energy with our traditional strengths in resources and manufacturing to build new opportunities, including in critical mineral processing, green metals, clean energy technologies and low carbon liquid fuels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It delivers on key elements of the government's Future Made in Australia plan announced by the government in the 2024-25 budget. It's a plan that is the single biggest investment in action on climate change in this country. It's a $22.7 billion investment. Add to this the $20 billion that we have allocated to Rewiring the Nation, the $67 billion of clean energy private investment that will be opened up with our Capacity Investment Scheme and much, much more, and you have the biggest industrial policy that this country has ever seen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does the legislation do? It provides the framework and imposes rigour on government decision-making and substantial public investments. It has three key components. They are: embedding the government's National Interest Framework to help identify sectors where Australia has genuine comparative advantage; establishing a robust sector assessment process to understand and remove barriers to private investment; and establishing a set of community benefit principles that will make sure relevant Future Made in Australia investments create strong returns for local communities, workers and businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Interest Framework is a game changer. It will prioritise investment in industries under two broad streams: the net zero transformation stream and the economic security and resilience stream. The net zero transformation stream will identify industries that can make a significant contribution to achieving net zero. The economic security and resilience stream will identify sectors that are critical to our resilience, that are vulnerable to supply disruptions and that require support to unlock sufficient private investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you can see, Labor is doing the work to address crucial challenges that we face as a country—challenges that no other party in this parliament is capable of addressing—because in the Australian Labor Party we are not just about slogans; we are about action. We're a party of government, a party that is about getting things done. You see, Labor doesn't waste the precious time we have in this place by going about throwing personal insults or jibes at individuals who are doing their jobs. We don't waste the parliament's time pulling stunts and moving motions without doing any of the complex work and the hard slog that needs to go into seriously changing the laws in this country. We take the time and we make the effort to help bring about real change, and that is what this bill delivers. It's been painstakingly written, with all the consultation, legal advice and genius that go into these things, and I commend the Treasurer and his team for the long, hard hours that have gone into drafting this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Speaker knows, the Labor Party is the party of working people, so a key part of this legislation is ensuring that the public investment, along with the private investment it attracts, flows to communities in ways that benefit workers and businesses. That's why a set of community benefit principles will be applied to the government investments. The principles will ensure that investments:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I started this speech by outlining some of the key pieces of legislation that I have been proud to witness in parliament, and today I am happy to add another bill to that list: the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024. It's a bill that takes into account the history of this country. It learns from the past to make change for the present and will set us up for the future. Whether it be action on climate, support for working people, energy sustainability or sovereign capability—however you look at it—this is truly a wonderful piece of legislation by the Albanese Labor government, and I commend it to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:07</span>):  When we talk about climate change, we often focus on the consequences of inaction. We talk about the floods and fires, the extreme heat and the destructive storms, and the existential threat that a warming planet poses to our society. But, alongside this environmental imperative, the need for urgent climate action presents a significant economic opportunity. It's an opportunity that people in my community want to seize, that green tech entrepreneurs want to talk to me about and that is the focus of the bills before the House today: the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 and the Future Made in Australia (Omnibus Amendments No. 1) Bill 2024. As the world weans itself off fossil fuels, Australia is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the clean energy transition. We have some of the best wind and solar resources in the world, we have many of the critical minerals that are key to the transition, and we have the skilled labour and stable institutional environment needed to make the most of these national advantages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The size of the prize is significant. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunshot</span> report, the BCA, the ACF, the ACTU and the WWF estimated that Australia could create 395,000 new jobs by 2040 in clean energy exports, by selling commodities like green hydrogen or renewable ammonia, by processing critical minerals and higher-value metals, and by providing clean energy services to the world. Other analysis suggests the opportunity is even greater. The Superpower Institute estimate the annual value of green iron could be $295 billion, around three times the current value of our iron ore exports, and green aluminium could be worth a further $60 billion, around six times the current value of our bauxite and alumina exports combined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is vital that we seize these opportunities, not least because the export markets that have served us in the past will decline in the future. In 2022, two of Australia's top three exports were coal and gas, fossil fuels that are being phased out. Together, more than 97 per cent of our trade goes to partners with net-zero targets. That means a failure to shift out of fossil fuels and into the industries of the future would not only be a missed opportunity; it would also leave our economy dependent on industries in decline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this transition won't happen by accident. And whilst I'm not typically an advocate of intervention—and frankly, some of the government intervention mentioned by previous speakers makes me uncomfortable—in this case there are three reasons I believe that the state has a role to play. The first is that we don't have a price on carbon. The destruction of a carbon price by Tony Abbott's coalition government has meant that the cost of fossil fuel pollution—what it does to our environment—is not factored into the cost faced by producers or reflected in the price paid by consumers. The result of this unpriced negative externality means that low-emissions manufacturing processors face a significant green premium and can struggle to compete. An economy-wide carbon price is the best, cheapest and most effective way to address this market distortion. But a lack of courage from both the major parties means we are in the world of second-best policies, and financial support for green industries is necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second reason for intervention is that markets don't provide incentives for the early research and in-development stages of new technologies, and this is an appropriate area for government intervention, because early investors face high costs, low returns and the risk of free riding. And knowledge can be intangible, and there can be productivity spillovers that we do want to capture and foster in the early stages of technology development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, time is of the essence. We have only a couple of decades left to transform to a net zero economy, and the long life of many industrial assets means they are poorly suited to rapid change. Market forces alone won't deliver the pace of change we need to limit temperature rise to close to 1.5 degrees and avoid the most extreme impacts of global heating. Last year was the hottest year on record. This year temperatures are even higher. The clock is ticking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Countries around the world recognise the need for action. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act contains more than $500 billion worth of funding to accelerate America's transition to net zero. In the EU the Net-Zero Industry Act provides extensive support to build manufacturing capabilities, matching many of the IRA subsidies. And in Japan the government has unveiled the green transformation policy to support more than $1 trillion in public-private financing opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a world that competes for capital resources and talent, these packages put our peers at a huge advantage. I have spoken to many of our best and brightest companies in this space and to bankers as well, and they tell me of those challenges, of how to keep the most innovative and exciting of our companies in Australia. This is a real concern to us right now, because without an appropriate response the programs will permanently tilt the scales of world trade in these critical areas away from Australia, consigning us to a future of fewer jobs and less prosperity. The global race is on, and we can't afford to be left behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, there is need for action; I accept that. However, there are many—and I would put myself on the list—who are concerned that the government's and previous governments' mixed track record when it comes to industry policy makes them nervous about the risk of picking winners, about the degree of ministerial discretion provided for in this legislation, about rent seeking by vested interests and about how ill-defined phrases like 'economic security' can be used to justify every minister's pet project. I'm worried about those who advocate for this policy on the basis of trying to bring back to Australia parts of manufacturing that have been gone for many years. While people do miss those jobs, we need to recognise that Australia's openness to trade, our ability to be a small trading nation, has actually been the bedrock of our prosperity and frankly the bedrock of the great economic quality of life that Australian consumers face. Frankly, if we had retained all the industries that I know many people wish were still here, Australian consumers would be the ones paying more, and that does no good for Australian prosperity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, I am concerned that this legislation can be used to justify things that are not in the interest of Australian consumers. Several of the concerns I have raised have been articulated by the chair of the Productivity Commission, Danielle Wood. And decisions made by this government, including things like the investment in a US quantum computing firm when there were other domestic options available and where they still haven't made a clear case as to why this company was invested in first, make me nervous. There are concerns here, but it doesn't mean we should do nothing. It doesn't mean we should sit on our hands. It means that we need to get this right. We need to get the legislation right, we need to get the actions right and we need to get the guardrails right to make sure that this policy is effective in delivering what is needed, driven by market failures, but is not used as an opportunity for wasting money and for wasting taxpayer money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It means that we need policy where government builds a portfolio of investments that is developed using arms-length expert advice with appropriate off ramps and using instruments where taxpayers share the benefit. It means that we need strong institutional guardrails that put a robust framework around decision-making, that provide transparency over where funds are invested and that ensure accountability for how money is spent. It means that we need an Australian response to the IRA that doesn't go toe to toe with the financial might of the USA but leverages the specific opportunities available to Australia in those critical areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to the bill before the House today. The bill creates the National Interest Framework to help assess sectors for support under Future Made in Australia. It sets out the community benefit principles to ensure investments deliver for the community, and it makes changes that ensure the EFA and ARENA can support this agenda. I support the intent of the legislation, and the submissions to the Senate inquiry show that there is broad support for this agenda from those in the environmental sectors, finance sectors and the business community, including the Clean Energy Council, the Investor Group on Climate Change, the Climate Council, Climate Energy Finance, the Superpower Institute, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Aluminium Council, the Business Council of Australia and many, many others. But the submissions also highlight that, as currently drafted, the bill fails to deliver the framework we need to effectively seize Australia's opportunity to become a clean energy superpower. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to industry policy, it's imperative that a robust and transparent framework is in place to ensure taxpayers get value for money. We can't afford to make the mistakes of the past, where money was wasted on bailing out failing industries that never had a chance of standing on their own two feet, which, frankly, only delivered higher prices for Australian consumers. That does not work. And so, with that in mind, I urge the government to consider six key changes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, sector assessments must be required before a sector can receive support. The bill is supposed to provide financial discipline around Future Made in Australia spending, but sector assessments are not currently required before a sector can receive support. The loophole needs to be closed so that there is appropriate discipline around government spending. The government must also publish the assessments it has conducted so far, including those which relate to announcements in the May budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, Treasury must consult with the Productivity Commission during these sector assessments. The independent Productivity Commission has vital expertise, experience and methodologies in this kind of analysis and a healthy degree of scepticism, which I appreciate. They are experts, and we should listen to them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, the government should clarify that, under Future Made in Australia, the support is not just financial. I think this is really critical because, time and time again, businesses have said, 'It's not just about government handouts and money. We actually have to get the operating environment right,' and this is where I do agree with elements of what the coalition is saying in this space. We have to get the operating environment right as well as ensuring that, where there is market failure, we are providing the support from a financial point of view. Both of those are critical if we are going to move forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourth, existing policies must be considered in sector assessments so that we can ensure additionality in measures put forward under Future Made in Australia and avoid duplication. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifth, sector assessments must consider the Climate Change Authority's Sector Pathways Review, which is already undertaking detailed analysis of the technology and emission pathways that will best support our transition to net zero.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sixth, it should be mandatory for sector assessments to be periodically reviewed so that taxpayer money is invested wisely on an ongoing basis. This would also help in building the off ramps in policy design, as has been recommended by the Productivity Commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While these six areas are my focus, I would like to acknowledge the importance of other amendments being pursued by the crossbench, which are focused, again, on stronger transparency and accountability provisions. These are things like accelerating the creation of a single front door for investors to help make sense of the plethora of government supports available across Future Made in Australia and programs like the NRF. These amendments from across the crossbench also try to ensure that the focus of Future Made in Australia is on supporting emissions reduction and net zero, rather than the broader and, frankly, much less well-defined notion of national or economic security. I believe there are issues of national and economic security. But those are, frankly, very broad areas where all sorts of issues can be hidden and popped away, and where money can be wasted. I think we need an absolutely robust indication of why a sector deserves support that cannot be provided by the market before we make these sorts of investments. It is clear, in relation to green technology and in other areas of technology, that the case still needs to be made and needs to be made clearly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Taxpayer support under the economic security stream of this legislation is much more open to porkbarrelling and abuse, and less justified by the market failures I outlined previously. We therefore need much stronger guardrails around investments and much greater clarity around the objective the government is trying to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to finish by talking about community benefits. The bill sets out a set of principles which should be adhered to by firms awarded support under the Future Made in Australia plan. It has good intent, and similar provisions are considered under the IRA. It is important that taxpayer investments do deliver well-paid jobs, and that First Nations people benefit in these new industries. However, these principles need to be defined in a way that also provides policy certainty for business. I have concerns that, as it's currently drafted, this may not be the case. I'm suggesting that the government considers and engages further with people like the Clean Energy Council and the Australian Industry Group to ensure that they have the right guardrails in this case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also would like to talk about how perhaps the most significant community benefit will be through future tax revenues, which we hope these future industries will generate. The Future Made in Australia plan will provide significant tax credits to industries like critical minerals and green hydrogen. I support these areas for those startup pieces. However, when companies get this great support from taxpayers and then earn, in the future, supernormal profits—if they have high prices—I also think it is appropriate for the Australian consumer, who has paid for the tax breaks, to get some of the benefits. It's vital that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past, where gas and mineral exporters have generated billions of dollars in profits for foreign-owned corporations but have not delivered for Australian taxpayers. I again urge the government to look at more serious tax reform.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to finish by concluding that the government needs to undertake this work with other pieces that will make it possible for us to realise our superpower advantages, because this will not deliver that on its own. Specifically, regulation reform through the EPBC, industrial relations reform through these areas and also an agenda around reducing complexity and red tape for businesses are all critical elements of a future made in Australia as well.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—Assistant Minister for Immigration) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:22</span>):  Australia needs a productivity boost if we are going to maintain our high living standards into the future. Income per head of the population in Australia has been falling for some decades. We had a small boost during the years of the mining boom, when there were large investments in capital that were associated with that, but that was short-lived. The previous coalition government had a very lazy approach to developing industry and basically no economic plan. They relied on resources and a 'she'll be right' attitude when it came to developing the Australian industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last government that had a substantial plan to boost productivity in Australia was the Hawke-Keating government. Their economic reforms laid the foundations for three decades of economic growth and prosperity and, importantly, a rise in living standards, ensuring that Australians' incomes were increasing and that their quality of life was increasing too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need an industry plan. The industry plan in the 1980s and 1990s was built on reform of manufacturing—on reform of the textile industry, reform of the automotive industry, reform of aviation and reform of financial services. All of these reforms to elaborately transform manufacturing ensured that Australia remained competitive in a very competitive world, particularly in South-East Asia, where nations were moving into a developing status and establishing manufacturing industries at a lower cost to Australia. We managed to reform our industry to compete into the future. Without those reforms, we certainly wouldn't be enjoying the incomes that we do today, or the living standards. It's time for Australia to develop and implement another economic reform plan similar to the one developed by the Hawke and Keating governments. That's what the Future Made in Australia plan is all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't simply rely on resources and a 'she'll be right' attitude. We need to plan to attract capital investment in industries that will generate income, particularly given that we have an ageing population with a shrinking workforce and an increasing reliance on services—particularly health and aged care services and the National Disability Insurance Scheme. If we're going to fund those services, we need to be generating additional income for the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The way to do that is through capital investment, but not just any capital investment. We need to make sure that we're investing in industries that will have a resilient future and will return income to the country. There's a global competition going on for capital investment. It's not so much happening in services, it's not happening in resources and it's not happening in infrastructure and construction. It's happening in renewable energy and the net zero economy and it's happening in artificial intelligence. Currently, a billion dollars a day is being invested in artificial intelligence in corporations throughout the world. Australia needs to make sure that we transform our economy so that we can compete for those vital investment dollars and create jobs and businesses, grow our economy and generate incomes for the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to those two industries, particularly the net zero economy and renewable energy, Australia has a natural competitive advantage. We've got the one thing that many countries don't have—both access to sunlight and access to wind. We've also got a great foundation and a great tradition of innovation when it comes to industry, particularly in this area. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This evening in the parliament, the University of New South Wales Showcase is celebrating their 75 years, and a big highlight of that showcase is reforms in the energy industry. The solar and photovoltaic developments that took place at the University of New South Wales have been commercialised throughout the world and there are no solar panels anywhere in the world that do not contain an innovation that was invented and commercialised at the University of New South Wales. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a great tradition of being able to compete in these industries but we need to make sure that we're anticipating where the growth is going to be and we're attracting the capital. That will involve the participation of government through an industry policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Enter our Future Made in Australia plan. It's about triggering that capital investment to ensure that Australia is an attractive place to invest and that those industries can establish themselves and have a future in our country. Our plan is about maximising the economic and industrial benefits of the global transformation to net zero and securing Australia's place in a changing economic and strategic landscape. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill delivers a number of elements of that Future Made in Australia plan. I want to talk about three key elements. Firstly, it embeds the government's new National Interest Framework to help identify where Australia has a genuine comparative advantage in a net zero economy or where we have an economic security and resilience imperative. Secondly, it establishes a robust sector assessment process to help improve understanding of how our government can best leverage private investment in areas of the economy aligned with the framework and help form rigorous government decision-making. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, it defines a set of community benefit principles to ensure that the benefits of the Future Made in Australia program support the private sector investment it enables to flow to local communities, workers and businesses. In those areas, particularly in renewable energy, Australia has a great tradition and has been successful in government, partnering with industry to commercialise projects and business opportunities that would have otherwise have not been able to attract commercial investment and commercial capital without the assistance of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm speaking of course of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. That body has been able to leverage support from government with private capital to generate some wonderful new innovative solutions to the net zero transition and to ensure that in the process we're creating solid, sustainable businesses and jobs for Australians. We've got a history of doing this and doing it well. The Future Made in Australia Bill builds on that tradition and ensures that government partners with industry to trigger that investment in renewable energy, in the net zero economy and in artificial intelligence so that Australia can attract those investors to this country, establish those businesses, establish those industries, create jobs and ensure that we do have a future that is made in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I rise tonight to talk about a petition from my electorate. It's a petition to the Hon. Speaker of the House of Representatives and members of the House of Representatives. It reads:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Heytesbury Settlement began in the 1960s as a soldier settler scheme, and is home to many family farms and small communities in south-west Victoria, centred around the service town of Simpson, and also serviced by Cobden, Colac, Camperdown and Timboon. It is situated within the most valuable agricultural region in the whole of Australia (Food and Fibre Great South West strategy, 2021-2023).</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Since the large-scale clearing of that time, many farms have worked to re-establish multi-species native plantings, enhance habitat, manage nutrient and run-off, and improve the amenity of this picturesque landscape. Tourists are increasingly attracted to the area for its rolling hills, lush pastures, native forests, wildlife, birds, and gourmet food and wine experiences.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The wide scale planting of blue gums ('green deserts') for wood-chip in the Heytesbury settlement district must be stopped before the landscape changes irreversibly, leading to harm to local communities, to employment, to local services and local food production.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community is very concerned about what is happening in the Heytesbury region. This is prime agriculture land that was cleared in the 60s and is now potentially facing the disappearance of all that prime agriculture land as blue gums get planted in that region. This is happening at an unprecedented scale and without the consultation of the local community. This petition has 628 paper signatories and it has 750 e-signatures—that's 1,378 in total. Nearly 1,400 people have signed this petition calling on the federal government to say, 'Enough is enough.' We want a moratorium placed on the purchasing of this land while these questions can be answered: what is this going to do to our prime agriculture land; what will it do to these native species; what will it do to the wildlife; what will it do to the birdlife; and, most importantly, what will it do to agricultural production in this prime agricultural land?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to be able to feed our own people, we have to be able to continue to feed the world, and if we get decisions like this, approved by the Foreign Investment Review Board and ticked off by the Treasurer, then we will see more and more of our prime agricultural land disappear. At a time when we should be feeding the rest of the world and at a time when we should be enhancing our prime agricultural land and the food production we get off it, we will be seeing that land disappear.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These nearly 1,400 signatures are saying, 'Enough is enough.' They want the government to pause. They want the government to put a halt to this type of activity and protect our prime agricultural land. I seek leave to table this petition.</span>

                  <a href="264170" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  The Albanese government is committed to delivering major infrastructure projects that actually deliver results. I couldn't be prouder to be standing here this evening as the member for Patterson while a major piece of infrastructure is being delivered in my electorate. To be fair, the initial planning for this major piece of infrastructure began 20 years ago, in 2004. It started with investigation, planning and ongoing community engagement. But we in the Hunter knew that we had to capitalise on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve access and, importantly, productivity for my community, for the broader Hunter region and, quite frankly, for the eastern seaboard of Australia. This is a game changer not only for the people of the Hunter but for all of those people who require the goods and services that travel up and down our major freeway, the M1.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A partnership has been developed between the state and federal governments, with a total commitment of $2.2 billion being invested into the M1 in Paterson. Extension of the M1 Pacific Motorway will create 15 kilometres of motorway, with two lanes in each direction, bypassing Hexham and Heatherbrae, along with interchanges at Black Hill, Tomago, Tarro and Raymond Terrace. There will be a 2.6-kilometre viaduct bridge across the mighty and beautiful Hunter River, the floodplain, the main north rail line and the New England Highway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you drive in that part of the world at the moment, you can't help but see that construction taking place right now. It is going to employ right now in the construction phase 2,700 people in a good road-building jobs. I want to give the nod of approval to those people constructing the road at the moment. The job site is incredible. Every night, all of the heavy machinery is lined up. It looks clean. It is really a sight to behold, even in construction. I know that, at the moment, there are a lot of delays around this part of the world. They are the sorts of delays that road construction brings. I know there's so much road construction going on across our beautiful region that it has caused havoc. I say to people that I am sorry about those delays, but I am not sorry that we are building something that is going to make a massive difference to our region. It is such a game changer. I know that, once all of this construction is finally finished and we're driving on this beautiful new road and this beautiful new bridge with all the great infrastructure, we're just going to be so pleased we have been through the pain of this construction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also going to create a further 700 jobs during construction for the additional part of the road, the Hexham Straight. I'm really delighted to be attending with my friend and parliamentary neighbour the member for Newcastle next week with one of the major girders going in, in a construction milestone. Construction on the extension is already underway. It commenced last year. Early project development includes vegetation clearing, controlling erosion and sediment, construction of embankment foundation and bridge piling. Weather permitting, the project is expected to be completed in 2028. I know that seems like a long time away, but, if you just think back, it wasn't so long ago we were locked down due to COVID. That time has gone by reasonably quickly, and I'm hoping the next few years will go by just as quickly so that we'll be on that M1 extension.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be improved traffic flow. It's going to create more reliable traffic times, reducing them by seven to nine minutes, and it's going to create really great connections for the connecting roads around it. Upon completion of the project, 25,000 vehicles a day will be redirected from key congestion points on the corridor, keeping commuters moving. Overall, there will be a 25 per cent reduction in the flow on the New England Highway and west of Hexham. It's been a long time coming, but we are delivering. The Albanese Labor government are delivering this motorway, and it's going to make a change not only for the travellers of our generation but for those to come.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Every three years, the government undertakes a regional telecommunications infrastructure review to examine the state of phone and internet connectivity in regional Australia. It looks at what's working well, where the gaps are and what needs to be done better. Poor phone and internet connections are one of the top issues I hear about from my constituents. That's why, in May this year, I helped bring together representatives of the nine local governments in Indi and the government's Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee. A public consultation at the Benalla Town Hall was also very well attended, with the unambiguous takeaway that the federal government needs to do better, because what I hear time and time again is that telecommunications aren't up to scratch in regional, rural and remote Australia. More than ever we work online, we study online, we access health services online and we keep in touch with our friends and family online, but we can't do any of these things if we can't connect. If we can't connect then we fall behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the regional Independent MP, I made a broad-ranging submission to the review, recording the experiences of people in Indi and making nine recommendations that would help close the digital divide between the cities and the regions. In order for the government to deliver on its commitment to better regional connectivity, it must accept and implement these simple but impactful solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Floods, fires or storms—extreme weather events—are a common occurrence across north-east Victoria, and too often our telecommunications networks are failing when extreme weather or emergency knocks out our power supplies. This is putting lives at risk. In the south of my electorate, Murrindindi Shire has highlighted the effects recent flood related power and telecommunication outages have had on local hospitals, emergency services and businesses. Further north, the people of Kariong still remember the weeks of isolation following the Black Summer bushfires. Outages like these threaten lives and undermine emergency services coordination, and the broader economic costs are significant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must increase resilience now before the next fire or flood arrives, not after. We need to increase funding for programs that fund community energy nodes and power backup for mobile phone towers in extreme weather events. The town of Jamieson recently installed a community energy node at the memorial hall, with the support of Commonwealth grants, to provide residents with shelter and communication for several days in times of emergencies. In my submission, I recommend that the government expand programs that will fund similar projects right across regional Australia. Jamieson is a fine case study.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Affordability is another major issue. I do not accept that a regional internet tax is the price that we must pay for living outside the major cities. The regional internet tax comes in many forms. It's families paying for expensive satellite internet because the NBN won't ever make it to them. It's businesses that miss out on sales because EFTPOS machines drop out of connection. It's farmers forced to buy expensive signal boosters just so they can run the farm using modern technology. This unfair burden falls onto regional Australians just because of where they live. It's not right, and I'm disappointed that affordability is not a focus of this government's review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also why I've recommended an expansion of the successful On Farm Connectivity Program, which supports primary producers to invest in new and necessary on-farm technology. Working with my Indi Telecommunications Advisory Group, I've long fought for more funding to fix the black spots that exist right across north-east Victoria, and I'm proud to say that, under Independent representation, Indi has received more funding under the Mobile Black Spot Program than any other Victorian electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want that for everyone in regional Australia. We're making progress, but there's always more to do. Unbelievably, this program has no funding guaranteed beyond 2027. I'm recommending that the government make the sensible decision to provide ongoing, guaranteed funding for the successful Mobile Black Spot Program. The program relies on effective cooperation between government, telcos and local communities. Secure long-term funding would mean we could fix more blackspots sooner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the final report due before the end of this year, I'll be watching closely to see what this government's plan is for closing the digital divide and ending the regional internet tax, because regional communities have had enough of second-rate services. It stops local communities and businesses from achieving their full potential, it threatens our safety and it is a handbrake on regional development.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  Tonight I want to pay tribute to my constituent Mohammed Al Ebrahimi, the CEO of People First Healthcare, in my electorate. Recently Mohammed was awarded the 2024 Victorian Young Achiever of the Year and the Connecting Communities Award at the 7NEWS Young Achiever Awards. Of course, I was very proud to support his nomination and subsequently thrilled that he actually won.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mohammed and his family are refugees from Iraq and have managed to turn personal adversity into personal success. In turn, they give back to the community through initiatives such as the establishment of the Beloved Community Group, a social group initially set up to assist elderly people reconnect with their community. A drop-in centre was built in the local shopping centre at Roxburgh Park, and anyone could pop in to have a cup of coffee, play cards or simply have a chat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As numbers grew, Mohammed's team provided staff who could, in language, answer questions about available health services in the area or anything else that impacted on the lives of our constituents. As numbers grew, formal social activities were developed to include fortnightly day trips, religious celebrations and education sessions. Advice and assistance were also given with AEC enrolment processes or even with completing a tax return. The group now has hundreds and hundreds of members, with thousands more engaged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2024, a beloved group was established in Sydney, with groups planned for other cities in the coming years. These initiatives form an extension of Mohammed's primary business, which is People First Healthcare, which helps support the activities of the Beloved Community Group. People First Healthcare is a Commonwealth approved care service for people who are elderly and disabled. Many of its clients are indeed refugees and immigrants who were born in the Middle East and who face significant barriers to accessing health services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mohammed started this business in the northern suburbs of Melbourne in 2019 and expanded it into the south-western suburbs of Sydney in 2022. Today the business services almost 1,000 clients and has almost 300 members of staff. Ninety per cent of the staff were formally trained by the company and now have recognised qualifications in the aged-care and disability sectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People First Healthcare has plans in the coming years to expand into other areas of Victoria and New South Wales, as well as other capital cities, servicing multicultural communities. In congratulating the team, I want to quote Mohammed, who says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As a child my parents instilled into me the importance of giving back to my community and improving the lives of others who were less fortunate. I was given an opportunity to do this in Australia and I do so with immense pride and sense of satisfaction. There is no end to this journey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Saturday, I also had opportunity to attend the annual Teej festival celebration. This is a female oriented festival organised by my wonderful Craigieburn Nepalese community at the Craigieburn global learning centre. Teej is celebrated around the months of July to September, during the monsoon season. It is special because it is celebrated by women in Nepal as well as in India, with a three-day festival where all of the women and young girls prepare for the occasion by wearing stunning red saris, beautiful jewellery and red tika, and it involves singing and dancing to traditional folk songs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the Teej festival in Nepal, women will fast to honour lord Shiva and pray for a happy marriage, with rituals that offer celebration both for the personal and for the bounty that nature has to offer. Certainly, the women in my local Craigieburn Nepalese community created a sea of vibrant red and glittering jewels as they celebrated this beautiful festival on Saturday afternoon. It was, as they told me, an occasion for the women to pamper themselves, beautify themselves and come together for shared enjoyment, good food and dancing. I want to thank Susan Gautam, the secretary of the Craigieburn Nepalese Community, for her warm welcome. I also want to thank Kusum Magar, the president of the Craigieburn Nepalese Community, and all those wonderful women who helped put this event together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to give a shout-out to Madhuri Maskey, an executive member of the CNC, for her leadership in this space and for her friendship. Madhuri has always been a source of knowledge on issues in relation to international development, gender equality, the prevention of gender based violence, the safeguarding of the rights of women, children and youth, and their engagement for social change. It was, as our lovely hosts said, an opportunity to preserve cultural traditions, to teach younger people the value of these traditions and, above all, to share them with the rest of the community. Indeed, the emerging Nepalese community in my electorate has now become a significant part of our local community landscape.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr WEBSTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  The Albanese Labor government repeatedly pat themselves on the back for their wage rise and subsidies for child care, but families in regional Australia are left out in the cold by a lack of availability and access. A subsidy is well and good if it solves the childcare access issue, but it does not. When some towns have no childcare places at all or a waitlist of 400 children and no centre at all, the situation is indeed dire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parents in Mallee regularly contact me, desperately seeking help in our childcare deserts. Lisa lives in a central Victorian town with a population of 8,000 people but only two childcare centres with waitlists that will mean her children may not ever be able to attend child care. There are also only two family daycare providers in the area, and they too are completely booked out. Every week, Lisa sees posts on local Facebook groups where parents are crying out for help, desperate for a solution to the childcare crisis. Families are forced to move away from Maryborough because they cannot find child care. Skilled workers are leaving, and those who stay are being pushed out of employment because there is no-one to care for their children. This childcare crisis is becoming an economic crisis, eroding the very fabric of our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the Wimmera and Southern Mallee, the By Five Early Years Initiative collected data in 2022 that revealed that there were 300 children on local waiting lists and 84 additional staff needed to meet the demand. But the data only tells part of the story. In many rural towns with populations of less than 5,000 people, there is no childcare service at all, so waitlists alone do not tell the tale of the huge hole that is hurting families. There is no waitlist for a service that doesn't even exist. Towns in Mallee are playing a game of musical chairs, minus the chairs. Service provision is ad hoc and reliant on luck, passion and the commitment of early learning staff, rather than on strategic development. Even where childcare services exist, they are hamstrung by workforce shortages, inadequate funding models and a lack of infrastructure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Hopetoun, the situation is equally dire. The Uniting Early Learning childcare centre recently closed because they could not find staff. This is devastating for the community, and the children are the ones bearing the brunt as parents struggle with the cost of living and drive for hours a week if they can secure a childcare place in another town. Gannawarra Shire Council has also sounded the alarm. In Kerang, at last count, there were 85 children under the age of three waiting for a place at the Gannawarra Shire Children's Centre. At the family daycare in Cohuna, 34 are waiting for a place, and 45 are waiting for a spot at Family Day Care in Kerang. The Victorian state government has committed to building an early learning centre in Cohuna, but, without a confirmed date, families and the local council are left with no ability to plan for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families parched in childcare deserts are not isolated incidents. My own policy adviser's children were on a waitlist in Swan Hill for more than two years—so long that her daughter started primary school before securing a childcare place. What have the Albanese Labor government done to address this systemic failure? Nothing. They have left families and rural councils to fend for themselves. The current funding model for childcare services is broken. Services in Mallee's rural towns rely heavily on Commonwealth subsidies that are cyclical and unsustainable. For the sake of the future of our communities, the Albanese Labor government must immediately address the regional childcare crisis, invest in the infrastructure needed to support new childcare centres, and address the severe workforce shortages that are crippling those services. Our children and their parents deserve better.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  On 11 July 1995 and in the days that followed, 8,372 defenceless Bosnian men, women and children were brutally and mercilessly killed by Serbian forces in and around the town of Srebrenica whilst the rest of the world, including UN peacekeeping forces, looked away. When such atrocities occur, it takes generations for the hurt and anger to subside, if ever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the years that followed, it was often vowed that what happened at Srebrenica should never happen again. Yet since October 7 last year, when Hamas insurgents brutally killed innocent and defenceless Israeli men, women and children and took over 200 as hostages, our daily television news services have broadcast graphic film footage of defenceless men, women and children having been horrifically killed, with other family members distraught and hysterically grieving. So upsetting are the news clips that news presenters warn viewers of the distressing nature of the film content.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So in plain sight, with the world watching, the carnage of Palestinian people in Gaza continues. To date it has been reported that over 40,000 Palestinian civilians have been killed in Gaza from targeted Israeli attacks and around 92,000 have been wounded. In a growing number of cases, those killed were refugees sheltering in a refugee facility, a school, a hospital or a mosque. The Netanyahu government's response that they were targeting Hamas operatives does not justify the loss of innocent Palestinian lives. The estimated 17,000 children who have been violently killed, of whom 2,000 were under the age of two, have had no say whatsoever in the Israeli-Palestine conflict. In the latest major incident, over 100 Palestinians seeking shelter in a school were killed by a targeted Israeli strike. Some 70 per cent of all Palestinian schools have now been bombed. Again, as in 1995 in Srebrenica, the world looks away while the atrocities continued.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the widespread destruction of lives and property, the Gaza Strip has become a humanitarian catastrophe. Food, water and medical supplies are scarce, there is no safe place to shelter, and fleeing Palestinians have nowhere else to go. These are people who, in most cases, have never known anything but oppression and war in their lives. It is reported that 1.9 million of Gaza's prewar population of 2.3 million have been displaced, whilst Israeli settlements continue to spread. Yet the Netanyahu government ignores international law, blocks humanitarian aid to fleeing Palestinians and hinders efforts to contain the spread of polio virus, whilst 40,000 cases of hepatitis have also been recorded since October 7. There are now credible allegations of rape, sadistic torture and killings of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even those who report what is happening are at risk. Some 113 journalists and media workers—with some reports putting the number as high as 160—have now perished in Gaza, with claims that many of them were deliberately targeted. That is the largest number of journalists killed in any war to date.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Understandably, global condemnation of the Netanyahu government grows louder, just as Hamas was rightfully and widely condemned for the October 7 massacre of Israelis. Of course, the Israeli hostages held by Hamas should be immediately and unconditionally released. Reports over recent days of a possible peace deal are encouraging, and I very much hope that a lasting peace agreement is reached where the hostages are released, where a ceasefire is permanent, where hostilities cease and where all Palestinian and Israeli people can live together in peace. However, it should not take a peace deal for the Netanyahu government to stop the carnage and destruction in Palestine. It should be a matter of human decency. Every life matters, and that includes the lives of the Palestinian people.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  My beautiful electorate of Mackellar on Sydney's Northern Beaches is not only a nature lover's paradise; it is also an absolute hub of arts and culture. So many of Australia's accomplished artists, from musicians and painters to writers and actors, call Mackellar home. The fine arts have a long and treasured history on the Northern Beaches, and they enrich all our lives daily.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are at a time where the creative community is often doing it tough on many fronts. Recently, I was visited by a local group of voice actors and a representative from the Australian Association of Voice Actors. Voice actors are people who lend their voices to TV and radio programs and commercials, podcasts, movies, audiobooks, video games and more. They came to see me because of the rapid and alarming trend they are seeing in their industry: the use of artificial intelligence to clone and usurp actors and famous people's voices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, as reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> in December 2022, Cooper Mortlock landed a steady gig as one of five voice artists working on an animated online series. He signed a contract for 52 episodes, to be recorded over 12 months, but, when it reached episode 30, his contract was cancelled. Then, about a year later, the producer released another episode, using an AI clone of his voice and the voices of the other actors. Even Scarlett Johansson recently alleged that OpenAI used an AI generated version of her voice for its personalised digital assistant. This happened after she had declined permission for her actual voice to be used in the app. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As it now stands, 90 per cent of voice actors in Australia are moderately to extremely concerned by the potential of the theft of their intellectual and creative work. Sadly, this is already happening, and voice actors' art and livelihoods are under real threat. The Australian Association of Voice Actors recently gave evidence to a Senate committee on artificial intelligence, stating that the jobs of around 500 Australian voice actors are already in danger from AI.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is lagging far behind other regions of the world when it comes to the protection of personally identifiable information. We need to follow the lead of the EU and their world-leading General Data Protection Regulation, whereby voice is regarded as a special type of biometric personal data for which consent of use should be through an explicit opt in, should be renewed regularly and must be 100 per cent independent of work contracts. This is an issue that needs urgent, decisive action and legislation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  This month, Canberra lost a giant. Terry Snow passed away aged 80, leaving a legacy as one of Canberra's greatest visionaries and philanthropists. Few could claim to have left such a mark on our city or changed the lives of so many as Terry Snow. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Terry was the grandson of Canberra's first general store owner and went on to become one of Australia's most successful property and commercial developers. One of Mr Snow's greatest contributions to Canberra was the redevelopment of the Canberra Airport precinct. In 1998, Mr Snow purchased land from the government and transformed what was a small airport surrounded by farmland into the impressive, modern airport that many people in this building would be very familiar with. His work saw passenger numbers double, with international carriers now in residence. As said by Mr Snow:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We have transformed our vision into reality for this city, and it is something of which I am incredibly proud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Snow family also agreed to develop the suburb of Denman Prospect, a new and beautiful suburb in the electorate of Bean. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Snow was a generous and committed philanthropist. His belief that, if you see someone struggling, you give them a helping hand, guided his generosity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of the Snow Foundation with his brother George in 1991 allowed Mr Snow to help quiet achievers in the Canberra community and provide funding to a diverse range of projects. These included projects helping people with disability and people experiencing homelessness. More recently he established Snow Medical, a research foundation that provides a fellowship for the next generation of emerging research leaders to change the face of health care in Australia. His family credits his deep sense of social responsibility as the driving factor for the creation of this organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Snow was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 2006 for his service to the building and construction industry, particularly the redevelopment of the Canberra international airport precinct and his support for charitable organisations. He also played an important role in saving the New South Wales South Coast town of Bawley Point during the 2020 Black Summer bushfires due to his intricate fire safety plan, developed to protect his beloved horses and staff at his equestrian arena. This meant his property was safe from one of the worst bushfires in recent history, and firefighters could focus their efforts on saving the town of Bawley Point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His desire to protect and help all people has had a phenomenal impact on so many people. He made an incredible contribution to our city and the lives of so many. My thoughts are with his family; his wife, Ginette; his children, Scarlett Gaffey, Tom Snow, Georgina Byron and Stephen Byron; and his 14 grandchildren. Vale, Terry Snow, and thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  Having the right to protest is a vital part of being a democracy. For me, free speech is a foundational belief. Protests allow all Australians to feel seen and heard about the issues that matter to us. I will never speak out against Australians' right to protest. Unfortunately, lately we've seen some far-from-peaceful protests. There has been property damage at electorate offices; intimidation of employees; and offices shut to constituents, for their own safety. Elderly attendees at a Labor Party dinner in Brisbane a few weeks ago received verbal abuse and were even spat at, shoved and punched. I was there, and what deeply concerned me was who the protesters were. This concern was echoed by a group of respected Muslim leaders I met with recently. I've had protesters at my office who all looked like me, and, at the dinner in Brisbane, so did many of the protesters. Yet, when these people return to their comfortable homes in their leafy suburbs and hang up their keffiyehs in their walk-in wardrobes, who will bear the brunt of public anger about the pushing and punching and speeding? The Muslim leaders I met with are worried that it will be their community members who will be targeted, their children who wear the clothes of their faith who will be blamed and bullied. They're concerned the abiding image of the protests and destruction of property will be that of 'the angry and violent Muslim'. These aren't my words. That's a quote from the discussion I attended. This image does not ring true in Moreton, where we prefer to share a meal and discuss matters—even the ones we disagree on—with sensitivity, with respect and with the aim of finding a constructive solution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, being tarnished with this image is familiar for many in the Muslim community. The memories of the aftermath of 9/11 are still strong. Many Muslims going about their everyday lives were vilified, harassed and discriminated against. More recently, we have seen the abhorrent vandalism of mosques, including a hateful act of leaving a pig's head at the door of one. And, during the last federal election, far-right fringe political parties espoused anti-Islamic immigration agendas. Is it any wonder that Muslim leaders are now worried about a similar pattern emerging? They're concerned about the politicisation in Australia of the war in Gaza deflecting attention from the absolute necessity of focusing on a ceasefire and the provision of desperately needed humanitarian aid—and not just in Gaza but also in the Horn of Africa and other conflict areas. Thankfully, the violent and abusive rent-a-crowd protesters are a small minority in this country. The responsible amongst us are continuing to strengthen relationships in our communities. That is what will keep modern multicultural Australia strong and cohesive, and that is what all representatives in this chamber, from all parties, should be doing. As the representative for Moreton, the most multicultural seat in Queensland, I'm proud to work on harmony always.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  On 1 July the Rockhampton region lost a legend of local government, a loyal friend to many and devoted father and husband, Councillor Neil Fisher. Neil's commitment to our region was unwavering, and he served our community with integrity and passion. His relentless efforts to enhance Rockhampton's region were nothing short of inspiring. Over the years, Neil's contributions have left an enduring mark on our local government and on the hearts of the people he served. One of Neil's most significant achievements was his passionate advocacy for the Rockhampton Airport. Neil's tireless work secured vital upgrades to the airport to ensure it could better serve our community. It was an honour for me to be able to deliver the funding necessary to bring his plans to life through terminal upgrades and establishing an aircraft maintenance facility. This work exemplified his vision for a prosperous future and his steadfast commitment to improving our community's infrastructure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Neil was known not only for his love of aviation but also for his love of horticulture. This was evident in his involvement in the beautification of many spaces across the local government area. Neil inspired many to take up gardening through his weekly horticulture segment on the local news. Personally, I gained invaluable knowledge from Neil, especially about growing orchids. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond his professional achievements, Neil was a man of immense character, compassion and warmth. His kindness and generosity touched countless lives. If there was a charity event, you could be sure Neil was there to provide support and a listening ear to those who needed it most. I will be forever grateful for Neil's unwavering support during my campaign to become federal member for Capricornia. His guidance and encouragement were vital to my success, and his belief in my vision served as a source of great strength and inspiration. I extend my deepest condolences to Neil's wife, Sherrie; his children, Jessamine, Corey, Gabriel and James; his son-in-law, Anthony; his granddaughters, Ruby and Lola; and his mum, Shirley. Today, as we remember Councillor Neil Fisher, let us honour his legacy of service, friendship and community spirit. He will be greatly missed, but his impact will forever resonate in the Rockhampton community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  Today in the Australian parliament I would like to recognise Councillor Greg Watson from Shoalhaven City Council, who has recently celebrated an amazing 50 years as a councillor and mayor and is retiring. I can honestly say that I have had the privilege of Greg Watson knowing me my entire life. We both lived at Terara when I was young, and it was Greg Watson who, just before he was elected in 1974, rescued me as a four-year-old from my family's dairy farm during the massive floods at Terara. In true Greg Watson style, he used his truck to evacuate people from the community. And, as a youngster, I was put in the front of the truck as we were evacuated into town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Greg was first elected as an alderman to Shoalhaven Shire Council in 1974. From my time as a young person growing up in the town, I have many fond memories, and I can honestly say that Greg was there every step of the way. Greg was a master at always thinking ahead, a political strategist, a relationship builder, a problem solver and someone that always had the community at heart. It was those qualities that were appreciated and saw Greg achieve so much for the Shoalhaven.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From establishing Flinders Industrial Estate and sealing roads to the REM Scheme, the aviation technology park, the Shoalhaven Entertainment Centre and more, what Greg achieved was nothing short of astounding. Greg's practical and proactive approach made him very popular electorally. It was Greg's idea to turn the Shoalhaven shire into the City of Shoalhaven, and that's what happened in 1979. Greg made sure that every schoolchild received a commemorative coin. I certainly received mine at Terara Public School,  and there was a huge street party in Nowra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it was when I was a mum with my own young kids that Greg re-entered my life in a more prominent way. It was during the save the Nowra pool campaign from September 2009 to 2015, where Greg would answer any of my questions. Greg provided advice when I asked for it but never expected me to agree. That's what Greg did. He was a mentor and always made time to help others. It was Greg Watson that encouraged me to enter into politics, and I suspect that Greg's main interest was that people entering politics should be doing so for the right reasons: for an absolute love of community, a genuineness and a true desire to serve our community for the better. Thank you, Councillor Greg Watson. You have left an incredible legacy and gift for us all from your dedication over the past five decades.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  The Normanhurst Eagles Football Club is one of the most successful in my area, with nearly a thousand players, one of the highest levels of women's participation across 79 teams and five wins across different competitions. A great club should have great facilities to match. This year too many of the club's games were called off due to the inadequacy of the oval. The Normanhurst Eagles clubhouse, which they share with the Normanhurst cricket club, is not fit for purpose. The change rooms are from the 1970s and don't adequately serve the growing women's participation. Smashed windows are from another era, and the rickety stairs exclude people with disability. I'll always be a champion for our local sporting clubs, because teams like the Normo Eagles play a vital role in creating healthy and active young people with a love of sport, and they foster belonging in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons I have fought so hard for better telco in the Berowra electorate is that our electorate is prone to bushfires and floods. I want to do everything I can to back in the RFS and emergency service personnel in keeping our community safe. So it concerns me when I hear that mobile communications are so bad that volunteers at the Hillside RFS struggle to get phone calls in and out of their station. This is 2024, and this is metropolitan Sydney. I'm sick of the chronic underservicing of my electorate by the telcos. They're endangering life and limb when they don't adequately service the RFS and our bushfire-prone areas. I'll always fight to ensure that emergency service personnel have what they need to continue to support our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John McAuley recently celebrated his 100th birthday. A remarkable Australian and the head of one of my electorate's most significant families, John enjoyed a distinguished career as an economist which culminated in his role as the chief economist at the State Bank. With his lively intellect, John's insightful commentary following every federal budget is something I always look forward to receiving. In 1946 John married Margaret O'Connor. They had three children, nine grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren. John served in the radar section of the RAAF in New Guinea in World War II. This year he was the only World War II veteran to march the full length of the Sydney Anzac Day march. John, on behalf of the Berowra community and the people of Australia, I wish you a very happy 100th birthday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Telecommunications is not a nice-to-have; it's a right. In 2016 I promised to deliver a new mobile phone tower to the Brooklyn-Dangar Island area. Despite Telstra's attempts to frustrate the project and come up with inappropriate locations, through working with the Dangar Island community and never giving up the fight we've achieved a great outcome. Telstra and NBN wanted to leave Brooklyn and Dangar Island behind, but in both cases I've delivered better mobile and NBN services as a direct result of my advocacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Improved telecommunications are about making it easier for emergency services personnel to do their job, it's about ensuring that people can work and study from home and it's about building future capacity for technological improvements. I'm so proud to have worked with a great community to deliver this vital outcome and ensure people have the telco they need to operate in the modern world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  Last weekend I attended the Bacchus Marsh 3340 volunteer network lunch at the newly completed Darley pavilion. This gathering brought together over a hundred volunteers from across the 3340 postcode to celebrate their tireless efforts in support of our community. This event was not only an acknowledgement of the incredible work our volunteers do but also an opportunity for these inspiring individuals and groups to connect, share their experiences and strengthen the bonds that make our community such a special place to live. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Claire Sutherland and Ian Prince as well as all of the staff from Community Bank Bacchus Marsh, and also John Cutler from the Darley Park Community and Sports Centre for their hard work in organising this fantastic event.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday was Vietnam Veterans Day and the 58th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. This occasion serves as a solemn reminder of the service and sacrifice of our brave service personnel. I recently had the privilege of meeting with the Melton Vietnam Veterans Association to discuss the commemoration. Their dedication to honouring our fallen soldiers and supporting our veterans is truly incredible. The association's motto, 'Remember the dead and fight like hell for the living', reflects their unwavering commitment to both memory and action. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Wayne, Jim and all the members of the association for having me and indeed for their tireless efforts and continuing service to our community, particularly our valued veterans.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is committed to backing Australian science and technology, and the Maker Projects grants are a testament to this commitment. These grants, ranging from $20,000 to $100,000, support organisations in delivering projects that help students and young people develop and apply their STEM knowledge. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Hawke we are already seeing the benefits locally. Thanks to a $70,996 Maker Projects grant in 2022, SciencePlay Kids is providing schools like Balliang East Primary School with access to free STEM kits. This initiative is equipping our students with the tools and the inspiration that they need to explore the very exciting world of STEM. Last week I had the pleasure of visiting Balliang East Primary School to witness all the incredible work being done in this space. I want to extend my thanks to principal Caryn and business manager Melanie for showing me around, and to all the teachers and educators across our community for their dedication to inspiring the next generation of STEM professionals. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  With the 2024 Paris Olympics wrapped up, I wanted to take the opportunity to congratulate the athletes who competed who are originally from my electorate. The south-west is really proud of producing six Olympians and one Paralympian: Kyle Lee from Australind in marathon swimming; Aran Zalewski from Margaret River in hockey; Jake Harvie from Dardanup in hockey; Lauren Reynolds from Bunbury in BMX cycling; Nina Kennedy, originally from Busselton, in the pole vault; Jack Robinson from Margaret River in surfing; and Alex Saffy, also known as 'the Bunbury bullet', competing in Paralympic swimming. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to Jack Robinson, who brings home the silver medal in surfing, beating three-time world champion Gabriel Medina of Brazil to claim a place in the thrilling final. Nina Kennedy, our golden girl—how good is that! Nina won the gold medal for her pole vault of 4.90 metres and made history as the first Australian woman to win gold in a field event. So congratulations, Nina; what an awesome result. Our South West Academy of Sport alumnus, Kyle Lee, in his first Olympics experience, finished in the top 20 in marathon swimming. He was cheered on by his family, who travelled with him to Paris. Lauren Reynolds made history at the games, becoming only the fifth BMX rider to compete in four Olympics. Well done, Aran and Jake, who, with the Kookaburras, fought hard and made it to the quarterfinals of the men's hockey. With the Paralympics up next, I can't wait to see how Alex Saffy goes. As we know, all of Bunbury is well behind Alex Saffy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really want to thank all of those athletes and their families. These athletes have often dedicated their lives to countless hours of training, preparation, hard work and cost, and there has been a lot of commitment by the families that support them. You have done yourselves and Australia proud. Nothing should overshadow or diminish the focus on your commitment, your hard work and your achievements, which have been achieved through countless hours of hard work and sheer dedication, often at all hours of the day and night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Please don't forget that the excitement is not over yet; the Paralympics are just two weeks away, and we want to celebrate all over again with our Australian athletes. As you would understand, with Alex Saffy from Bunbury in the swimming, the south-western people of Bunbury will certainly be watching this with a great deal of interest and excitement.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300126" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr REID</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  I rise on this occasion to acknowledge Julie Donaldson, a local intensive care nurse at Gosford Hospital, who has put away her stethoscope for the last time and retired from her nursing career. Julie's career spans 35 years. She started working in the intensive care unit at Gosford Hospital in 1989 and has an impressive list of achievements under her belt. Anyone who happened to work alongside Julie will know the incredible dedication, commitment, passion, compassion and exceptional care she tirelessly brought to her nursing career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Julie always provided outstanding care and assistance to patients in the ICU. Never losing composure, she was unfaltering and confronted any challenge with perseverance and a sense of calmness. Often a source of wisdom and knowledge, Julie would be sought out by doctors and colleagues for advice on all manner of circumstances. A facilitator of further training and education for fellow nurses, she was always looking for ways to strengthen the profession and build up the skills of her colleagues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Julie was responsible for helping to establish the baby basket for those babies who started their lives in the ICU. These baby baskets go a long way towards helping parents of newborns provide the best care possible for their young babies. Julie's charitable endeavours did not stop there. She initiated the 100 club, which aims to support multiple charities on the Central Coast and right across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A truly selfless public servant, always putting others first and never seeking recognition for all the amazing work that she has undertaken, Julie is the personification of humility and an inspiration to many who have known her and have worked alongside her. She has set the bar high, and I know that our community will miss her dearly in her retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now read a couple of thank-you messages sent to me from her colleagues at Gosford Hospital. This is from Jodie: 'It was always a pleasure working with you. Your knowledge had no bounds—absolutely endless. We had many a fun night shift. Congratulations on a stellar career, my friend. Now, to enjoy your retirement. So deserved. Congratulations'. And this is from Cath: 'Well, the guru is finally hanging up her stethoscope. Sad day for staff and patients. Julie, I have loved working with you back in my ICU days. So much knowledge and compassion that made you one of best nurses ever. I will always treasure my memories of us working together.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Julie, on behalf of the people of the Central Coast, I want to express my thanks and my gratitude to you for your service as a nurse for the last 35 years. Congratulations on a phenomenal career.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I brought this motion to the House because we have a real opportunity to transform early childhood education and care in this country. It seems incredible to me that a sector as important as this is out of reach for so many families, and that the cost of early childhood education is often the second highest expense in a household after the mortgage. Rising fees, staff shortages, a lack of funding and a lack of vision have plagued what should be an accessible and affordable place for children to learn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start with cost because the cost of living is the biggest issue facing Australians right now. The cost of early childhood education in Australia is among the highest in the OECD. For a lot of parents, the cost of care means they simply can't afford to work. It's often referred to as a cost-of-working crisis. The HILDA survey collects data on spending for more than 7,000 households every year. It's found that about 83 per cent of families spend more on child care than on utilities or clothing for all members of the household, 70 per cent spend more on child care than transport and 30 per cent spend more on child care than groceries.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unaffordable child care often results in parents, usually women, deciding not to work, beginning lifelong gendered financial disadvantage. Yet again, women are bearing the brunt of decades of male centric priorities. But, at last, the conversation is changing. The Women's Economic Equality Taskforce put child care firmly on the political agenda when it stated that Australia should move towards adopting a universal childcare system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission's draft report has recommended that every child have access to three days of quality child care a week and, for families earning less than $80,000, it should be free. The Prime Minister has given his commitment to working towards a universal system. This is a commitment that I not only support. It's also one that I will fight to see delivered for women, for families, for children and for the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women in Australia are among the most highly educated in the world and have similar levels of labour force participation to men until they have children, when they begin to fall behind and never catch up. The differences are most pronounced in families with children under the age of five. The extent to which child care is available and affordable has consistently been found to lift rates of female participation. The Impact Economics and Policy 2023 report found that if labour force participation rates for females in families with children under five were to increase to match male participation rates, there would be an additional 301,000 women in families with children under five in the labour force. Our job as policymakers is to remove this barrier of returning to work for the sake of women, families and the economy. Yes, affordable and accessible child care is critical to growing the economy. More women working boosts economic growth and tax revenue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, early childhood education is crucial for children. By the age of five, 90 per cent of a child's brain is fully developed. Children who attend quality early childhood education are twice as likely to reach their development targets when they get to school. Early childhood education is the golden ticket. Children, families, women, the economy—it ticks all the boxes. This is why we must find a timely pathway to a universal system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the Productivity Commission and the Centre for Policy Development recommendations that every child have access to three days of quality child care a week as a first step. That would give all children the start they need by increasing attendance, especially for those experiencing disadvantage. It would help alleviate cost-of-living stress for families and it would advance gender equality by getting women back into the workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's decision to fund a 15 per cent pay increase for educators, which I strongly fought for, is also a win for gender equality in the female dominated early childhood sector. A valued and respected workforce underpins everything. Now is the time to start shaping the system we want for our children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 25 years ago, Quebec introduced universal $5-a-day day care. Today, the workforce participation rate for women aged 25 to 54 is 89.4 per cent. Increased tax paid by those working women has entirely offset the cost, and Canada is now introducing $10-a-day child care to the rest of the country. Now is Australia's chance to move with certainty in the same direction.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:04</span>):  I thank the member for Goldstein for raising this private members' business and allowing me to reflect on the important work that the Albanese Labor government is undertaking in the area of early childhood education and care. Our government is committed to recognising and harnessing the transformative benefits early childhood education provides for children and families across the country; the member for Goldstein has well articulated those. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government understands the early years of a child's life are crucial. This period lays the foundation for cognitive, social and emotional development. Investing in early childhood education is not just about the present; it's about shaping a better future. It's about providing every child with the opportunity to thrive, regardless of background or circumstance. That's why we are on the path to building a universal early childhood education and care system accessible for all families. It takes time, member for Goldstein, but we'll get there, I'm sure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In pursuit of this aim, the Australian Labor government has already taken significant steps to make early childhood education and care more accessible for more Australian families. Our cheaper childcare reforms are testament to this commitment, making early childhood education more affordable for more than a million families. These reforms have reduced out-of-pocket costs for centre-based daycare by 11 per cent while preserving higher subsidies for families with multiple children in care. In total, these changes benefit more than a million families, including 265,000 families in regional Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Labor government's commitment to the sector extends beyond affordability. We recognise the quality of early childhood education is intrinsically linked to the wellbeing of those who provide it. Early learning educators and teachers play a vital role both in the lives of our youngest Australians and in enabling millions of Australians, mostly women, to balance work and family life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After just two years of Labor government, the early childhood education and care sector has grown by more than 30,000 workers. This is a direct result of our efforts to collaborate with the sector to develop practical solutions for staff retention and strengthen recruitment and training. The Australian Labor government has provided more university places for early childhood education teachers. We've introduced fee-free TAFE and supported pay increases totalling 14.85 per cent in just two years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this month, the Australian Labor government delivered an historic achievement, a 15 per cent wage increase for early childhood workers, phased in over two years, starting in December this year. This increase, the largest ever for these essential workers, will significantly improve the livelihoods of our educators. For example, a typical educator will see a rise of at least $103 a week, increasing to $155 by December 2025. Early childhood teachers will see their pay increase by $166 a week, reaching $249 by the end of the two-year period. This will improve retention and recruitment and will better recognise the vital work early educators do. It represents a $3.56 billion commitment to our educators, with conditions ensuring funds are passed directly to workers through increased wages and with a limit of 4.4 per cent being put on providers, in terms of fee increases. That's important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals dismiss this significant wage increase as a mere few dollars a week. These are the same people who said two years ago that a $1 rise in the minimum wage would wreck the economy. The fact is that, no matter what argument they mount, the Liberals always oppose pay rises for Australian workers. While I'm on the topic of the Liberals, it's got to be said that Liberal Senator Gerard Rennick has made claims that child care will 'destroy the family unit' and that it brainwashes children early with the 'woke mind virus'. I'm just absolutely appalled by these comments. I'm even more appalled by the fact that the opposition leader is standing by that senator with that. We knew that under the opposition leader, Mr Dutton, there would be a shift to the right. I don't think we anticipated the shift to the weird.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I go, I'd like to thank the United Workers Union in Tasmania, led by Amy Brumby and lead organiser Jo Murphy, for the incredible work they've been doing in representing early childhood care workers and fighting for fairer conditions for them. This wouldn't have happened without the incredible work they have done.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  The first years of a child's life set them up for success. By the age of five, a child's brain is almost fully developed, with vision, hearing, vocabulary, personality, social skills and cognitive function all growing exponentially during the early years. Studies show that children who attend quality early-childhood education during these years are twice as likely to reach their developmental targets once at school. Early-childhood education is a critical factor for our future productivity and equality of opportunities for all. But it is also critical for women and economic empowerment, because, despite the progress we've made, the care role continues to fall to women, with 35 per cent of women citing caring for children as a reason for not being in the workforce or for not taking on more hours compared with only 7.5 per cent of men. This plays out through lower financial outcomes, including lower superannuation, and greater dependence on male partners. Ensuring access to childcare sounds like a no-brainer, and while some parents do prefer to care for their children themselves during these precious early years, the reality for many is that it's not a matter of choice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are real challenges across Australia and on the ground for families trying to access quality and affordable early-childhood education, including in my community of Wentworth. In Paddington, just a few weeks ago, I spoke with several young families who told me that mothers were thinking of leaving the workforce or not going back as fast as they would like to because of childcare costs. Some were even contemplating not having a second child. Many families in my electorate of Wentworth pay up to $200 a day for child care, which, for a family with two children, costs about $60,000 a year even for part-time care. Waiting lists can be several years along, even if you enrol your kids before they're born, and you're not even guaranteed a place before their first birthday. Subsidies are available, but they taper out, so it's many educated women with strong professional careers who are making those decisions not to engage in the workforce as much as they would like to. That is a problem for everyone, because Australia has, as the member for Goldstein mentioned, some of the highest-cost early-childhood education in the OECD, with childcare costs being a critical cost-of-living issue in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, speaking to educators, it's no wonder it's so hard to find affordable child care. Working conditions can be tough, the days are long, and it's hard to retain good quality staff despite the demand, because childcare workers remain some of the lowest-paid workers in Australia, with an average salary of just over $60,000. It's not just the cost. Childcare workers get into the profession because they love dealing with children. But the current regulatory settings mean that I constantly hear from childcare centres in my electorate that the box-ticking in the paperwork is taking our childcare workers further and further away from the work that they do with the kids and more into the paperwork. That is not something they want nor what is best for the quality of care for our kids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are systemic problems that can't be solved overnight. I want to acknowledge the significant progress that has been made during this term of parliament and which myself and others really pushed for. Workers' childcare costs were reduced for about 1.2 million families last year through the increase in the child subsidy rate. This is an area I strongly supported. Childcare workers are soon going to receive a welcome and long-overdue 15 per cent pay rise—again, something I strongly support and that is highly deserved. These are positive steps forward, and it's no coincidence they've come at a time when there are record numbers of women in parliament, although notably not on all benches in the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are being tentative in an area where the economic case, the social case, the case for opportunity and the case for women's empowerment is so clear. My country and my community want us to be a country where every Australian family can access early education and care that is affordable, and that's what this motion today is all about. I urge the government, who have said good words about universality and affordability of child care, to set out a timeline and a pathway to achieving this goal. It will reduce the financial burden on families, building on the experiences of Quebec and places where the cost of this sort of policy has been offset by the increase in women's tax payments. That ensures that our early educators are properly paid for the amazing work they do and reduces the burden of red tape and bureaucracy, which actually drives some really good people out of early-childhood education and care, because that's not what they got in there for; they got in there for the kids. It is time to take real action in this parliament.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  I rise today to reaffirm the Albanese Labor government's deep commitment to early childhood education and care. We understand how transformative early education can be, not just for our children but for families across the country. It forms the foundation for future success and strengthens the social and economic fabric of our society. Our goal is simple: to build a universal early childhood education and care system that is accessible to all families, regardless of your circumstances or background. Every child deserves the best start in life, and every family should have access to affordable, high-quality early education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that children who experience disadvantage and vulnerability are those who stand to benefit the most from early childhood education, and they are often the least likely to attend. This inequity is something we must work hard to change. Early learning helps close developmental gaps that can appear even before a child starts school. For children from disadvantaged backgrounds, early childhood education and care offers a crucial opportunity to build skills, confidence and a love of learning that will stay with them for life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cheaper childcare reforms are making a real difference for over a million families, easing the financial burden while ensuring children receive the education they need during these critical early years. These reforms are not just about improving access to care; they are about investing in our children's futures. But it's not only the children who benefit. Early childhood education and care plays a pivotal role in supporting parents, especially mothers, by enabling them to maintain a connection to the labour force when their children are young. When affordable and quality care is available, it empowers women to return to work, continue their careers and contribute to the economy. The benefits are twofold: families gain financial stability, and our economy benefits from increased workforce participation and productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also recognise the vital work being done by early learning educators and teachers. Every day, parents trust early educators with the most important people in their world, and, every day, Australians ask early educators to do one of the most important jobs imaginable—shaping the future of our children. That is why we are making sure these educators are fairly paid. The Albanese Labor government will fund a 15 per cent wage increase for early childhood education and care workers. This significant wage increase is a critical next step in our ongoing reforms to the sector, building on the success of our cheaper childcare changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this wage increase will be tied to a commitment from childcare centres to limit fee increases. We want to ensure that workers are fairly paid without the costs being passed on to families. This commitment will help retain our existing early childhood educators, who are predominantly women, and attract new employees into this vital sector. This is better for parents, better for educators and good for Australian businesses. By improving access to quality early childhood education and care, we can also boost productivity and workforce participation, both in the short and long term. This benefit doesn't just extend to early childhood centres. The wage increase will also apply to workers in outside-school-hours care services, creating significant advantages for the parents of school-age children. This increase will be phased in over two years, beginning with a 10 per cent rise from December 2024, followed by further five per cent increase from December 2025. This means that a typical early childhood educator paid at the award rate will receive a pay rise of at least $103 per week, growing to at least $155 per week by December 2025.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Early childhood education and care workers are some of the most important workers in the country, and they deserve to be paid fairly. Our $3.6 billion investment recognises the vital role that early childhood education and care workers play in preparing our children for school and for life. This is a win for workers, a win for families and will help ease cost-of-living pressure. Since coming to government, we have seen the number of early childhood education and care workers grow by more than 30,000, but we need more. In my community of Pearce, there are eight babies born a day to local families. The Albanese Labor government is committed to building a skilled, sustainable workforce that will help us achieve a truly universal early education system for all Australians. The Albanese Labor government's cheaper childcare initiative ensures that early education and care will remain available and affordable for families right across the country whilst laying the foundation for our nation's future economic successes. I thank the member for Goldstein for bringing this motion to the parliament.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak to this excellent motion on the first day of National Skills Week—and what a fantastic week it is. No government has done more to support Australians getting the skills they need than the Albanese Labor government. Over 500,000 people have been supported by fee-free TAFE since the beginning of the program on 1 January 2023; that is an astonishing number. In the first year of fee-free TAFE in 2023, there were over 355,000 students enrolled against a target of 180,000 places. Importantly, fee-free TAFE is supporting disadvantaged and in need Australians, with 35,000 people with disability and over 30,000 First Nations Australians taking up opportunities provided by fee-free TAFE.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my beautiful electorate of Dunkley, over 2,000 apprentices are currently working towards a nationally recognised qualification because of the program. It's motivating to see Dunkley residents benefiting from the fantastic opportunities that Labor governments provide. Fee-free TAFE has changed the lives of so many, helping address skills shortages and helping students by removing financial barriers. Fee-free TAFE is not wasteful spending, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has described; it's an investment in people and their ability to have a career, and the ability to support people into jobs in building and construction, child care and nursing—areas where we have skills shortages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I did not benefit from fee-free TAFE when I was a young woman studying to be a youth worker, TAFE certainly changed my life for the better. After working as a secretary I went to study youth work and community development at what is now Chisholm TAFE, keen to build the skills and knowledge to enable me to have a career supporting young people who are disadvantaged. My experience at TAFE was incredibly empowering. It was the impetus for me realising my capabilities and my passion supporting others to reach their potential. Studying at TAFE was the first of many steps in a love of lifelong learning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">TAFE gave me the confidence to go on and complete other study. I have now completed many other postgraduate qualifications. The last course I completed was a certificate IV in training and education—which enabled me to become a TAFE teacher, supporting others to study youth work and community development. Now, my niece and a close friend are taking up the opportunity fee-free TAFE provides. My niece has just applied for nursing, and Jemma, from Rosie's Cafe, in Frankston South, has just commenced studying a certificate IV in child care at Chisholm TAFE. Jemma said to me just yesterday:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Starting the certificate III in early childhood education has been such a positive experience. It feels good to be pursuing something I am passionate about and that I feel can make a meaningful impact to the future of our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Fee free TAFE has helped me begin my journey to a career that I am passionate about, and I look forward with nothing but excitement to the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This testimonial says it all, doesn't it? Jemma is just one of the many people who wanted the opportunity to learn and have a career, and needed the financial support to make this a reality. By removing financial barriers to study, fee-free TAFE is giving Australians from all walks of life the opportunity to get a secure, well-paid job with career progression, with training provided in areas of high demand and skills need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The best part is it is women who make up the majority of enrolments—almost 63 per cent—with over 277,000 women taking on a qualification under this initiative. We know through the work of the Minister for Women, Katy Gallagher, that the cost to the Australian economy for women being underemployed is $28 billion per annum. Fee-free TAFE is mobilising more women into education, which leads to employment and, for many—like me—a career. Fee-free TAFE is an exceptional policy achieving exceptional outcomes. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  Australia certainly needs top-class, effective training. However, it won't just be the number of enrolments and commencements that are the measure of whether the $1.5 billion of taxpayers' money that the Labor government is spending on this policy is actually being spent wisely. The true test will be whether each one of the students complete these courses, meaning the completion and the qualification rates will be the measure of success for this policy, as will whether the students are genuinely skilled, job ready and able to do the jobs the employers actually require. Equally, in regional areas, a measure of success will be whether the students are training in the areas of particular workforce shortages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are already concerns given that the estimates of TAFE completions are showing the failure, or non-completion, rate could be as high as 55 to 60 per cent. For example, in Victoria, just one per cent of those registered for a free certificate IV in plumbing successfully completed their training. Labor speakers talking today need to confirm just how many of Labor's 500,000 fee-free TAFE courses have resulted in a real qualification being completed, leading to a real qualified worker. Taxpayers have a right to know how many cancellations or noncompletions there have been across those enrolments and, equally, how many of these enrolments were not genuinely new places, as opposed to those that were going to be there anyway, without that additional $1.5 billion cost to taxpayers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason these details are so important is that, under Labor, skills are going backwards, so completion and qualification rates are critical. The latest data released by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research shows that Australia has lost over 85,300 apprentices and trainees from the national training pipeline since the Labor government took office—a loss of one in five. This means Labor has squandered almost all the gains made by the coalition government in building up Australia's skills pipeline. It also comes at a time when Labor is bringing in over 1.15 million migrants, which is putting extraordinary pressure on housing, infrastructure, hospitals, schools and health services—and of course we're building only 265,000 new homes. At the same time, we're seeing worsening skills shortages, unaffordable and soaring energy costs, stalling housing constructions and record insolvencies in the building sector itself. No wonder there are 5,300 fewer construction trades worker apprentices in training since Labor took office. Added to this, new-start apprentices and trainees have dropped by 23 per cent, the number of female apprentices and trainees in training has fallen by 25 per cent and the number of female commencements has fallen by 40 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The harsh reality facing the Australian people, with Labor's shocking economic failure and the additional $315 billion of new spending driving homegrown inflation, is that Australia is building fewer homes and the skills shortage has become far worse. We've lost one in five apprentices and trainees across the country, and Australians cannot find accommodation, housing or rental properties. Australia needs more apprentices and trainees, not fewer, for businesses of all sizes, from small and medium family businesses through to major businesses and industries. Labor promised they would solve the skills shortages. Well, they haven't done so. Unfortunately, it's just another broken promise made to the Australian people, along with the broken promises to lower power prices, to fix the cost-of-living issues and to lower mortgage costs, amongst so many other broken promises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Jobs and Skills Australia, 36 per cent of occupations were assessed as being in shortage in 2023, up from 31 per cent in 2022, and 66 occupations were added to this list in 2023. Effectively, this means over 330 occupations are in shortage in Australia. Clearly, the 1.15 million migrants Labor has opened Australia's doors to have not filled and are not filling these shortages because Labor has failed to target skilled migrants in its open-door migration policy and has failed to support and train Australian apprentices and trainees in the numbers that are needed. To add insult to injury, not only has the new Minister for Skills and Training role been taken out of cabinet but it's clearly not a priority for the Labor government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="157125" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  As we begin National Skills Week, it is time to celebrate and acknowledge the importance of skills development and vocational education in Australia. This week we stand at a crossroads where our commitment to education and training meets the growing needs of industries crucial to our nation's future. There is no better example of this commitment than the fee-free TAFE program, a program designed to support Australians in gaining the skills they need to secure well-paid jobs in industries that are experiencing critical skills shortages. Since its inception on 1 January 2023, fee-free TAFE has already provided over half a million Australians with the opportunity to pursue education and training without the financial burden of tuition fees. That's half a million individuals, many from vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, who are now on the path to a brighter future, whether they're training to be care workers, tradies or technology specialists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond individual benefits, fee-free TAFE is about more than just education; it is a critical component in addressing the growing skills shortage in key sectors that are essential to our national growth and resilience. In particular, the care industry, technology and digital sectors, early childhood education and care, and construction are all facing substantial shortages that we must fill if we want to remain competitive on the global stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The results speak for themselves. In its first year alone, fee-free TAFE has supported over 355,000 student enrolments—almost double the initial target of 180,000 places. Enrolments across priority sectors have been especially strong, with over 120,000 in the care sector, over 45,000 in technology and digital, and 32,000 in early childhood education and construction. These aren't just numbers on a page; they represent real lives being transformed, real gaps being filled and real progress being made in securing our nation's future workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we launch the future fee-free TAFE, it's well on track to continue making an impact. Through an historic partnership with states and territories, the Albanese Labor government has committed over $1.5 billion to deliver 500,000 fee-free TAFE places between 2023 and 2026. This investment isn't just an expenditure; it's a down payment on a better Australia, one with a skilled workforce ready to meet the challenges of tomorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are proud that fee-free TAFE is not just addressing skills shortages but also targeting priority groups who have historically faced barriers to education and employment. Among those enrolled, along with 158,000 young people, are over 117,000 jobseekers, almost 35,000 people with disabilities and over 30,000 First Nations Australians. These are the individuals who need support the most, and fee-free TAFE is providing that support by removing financial barriers and offering them a path to secure, fulfilling careers. But let's be clear. This isn't just about statistics and policies; it's about real savings for everyday Australians. Students training in critical fields like childhood education and civil construction have saved thousands of dollars thanks to fee-free TAFE.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we celebrate the success of fee-free TAFE, it's important to acknowledge that not everyone shares this vision. In fact, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has described fee-free TAFE as wasteful spending. Yet the evidence is clear. Fee-free TAFE is not only providing Australians with the skills they need to get ahead but also strengthening the workforce in industries that are desperate for qualified workers. What is even more concerning is that the opposition has offered no alternative plan. At a time when Australia faces critical shortages in key industries, they have refused to support additional fee-free TAFE and VET places.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Australian deserves a chance to secure a well-paid, stable job with career progression. Every industry vital to our future deserves the workforce it needs to thrive. That is why we have put TAFE at the heart of our vocational educational and training sector. We understand that a strong VET sector is key to providing Australians with the training they need to secure a brighter future. By working with the states and territories to deliver fee-free TAFE, we're ensuring that our investment is reaching those who need it the most, and that is having a real impact on addressing the skills shortages that we face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we begin National Skills Week, let us celebrate the transformative power of education and training; let us commit to continuing to build a strong, resilient and skilled workforce; and let us stand firm in our belief that investing in the skills of our people is the surest way to invest in the future of Australia. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298840" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  One of the most important investments any government can make is in education. When we invest in education we're investing in the future of our country. Unfortunately, the previous government neglected key parts of our education system, particularly TAFE. The consequences have been clear. When we came into government, we faced nationwide skills shortages. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not an economist, but I am a proud TAFE graduate, so I know that, when you make it harder and less affordable for people to attend TAFE, you end up with Australian businesses struggling to find skilled workers. You end up with skill shortages, but we are fixing this. Fee-free TAFE is helping Australians study in areas where we need skills the most, like future care workers and tradies. The evidence shows that this is working. Fee-free TAFE is on track to boost the supply of skilled workers in critical industries, particularly in care, technology and digital, early childhood education and construction. This policy is nation building and life changing for everyone who is now getting a free tertiary-level education. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our approach, when it comes to getting people trained in the area of their choice, is quite different to those opposite. Those opposite have never cared about TAFE, and they never will. That's why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition described fee-free TAFE as 'wasteful spending'. But it's not just one of their opinions on that side. Their disregard for TAFE is deeply ingrained. Let's not forget that there wasn't a single skills policy in the opposition's budget reply speech. They have refused to back our additional fee-free TAFE and VET places for construction, our expanded access to new energy apprentices, our expanded capacity for training facilities and the trainer workforce, our support for women's careers in VET, or our increased financial support to prioritise apprentices and their employers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time we have tried to rebuild TAFE, they have tried to stand in the way, but this hasn't stopped us from getting on with the job. We have delivered fee-free TAFE, helping hundreds of thousands of Australians pursue the jobs of their choice. The early data reported by states and territories, up to 30 June this year, tells us that fee-free TAFE has helped create over 500,000 enrolments nationally since it commenced on 1 January 2023. We had a target of 180,000 places in the first year of fee-free TAFE in 2023. But we didn't just deliver on this; we overdelivered. We smashed our target, with over 355,000 student enrolments. This shows that, when TAFE is affordable and accessible, people will seize this opportunity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Enrolments in fee-free TAFE have been strong across all priority sectors. We've had over 120,000 care sector course enrolments. There were over 45,000 technology and digital sector course enrolments. There were nearly 32,000 early childhood education and care sector enrolments and over 32,000 construction sector course enrolments. Just think about everything that will get done with the extra few hundred thousand skilled workers that we have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a proud product of TAFE. It taught me the skills that I needed to be able to gain the good, secure employment which has supported me for the whole of my working life. It also taught me the important lessons about life. Leaving school at 15 to do my trade, I was thrown into the real world very quickly. But this has helped shape the person I am today. School was never for me. I never loved it, and I definitely never thought about going to university. I will be forever grateful that I was able to go to TAFE and learn the skills and live the experiences I have had.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're a young person right now and don't think school is quite for you and don't want to go to university, that's okay. TAFE gives you the chance to get qualifications in doing something you love. Whether you want to be a chippie, a leco, a plumber, a boiley, a mechanic, a tiler, a plasterer or a childcare educator or to have a qualification in hospitality, or maybe you want to be a fitter and turner just like me, we want to make sure that you're able to go to TAFE and get a high-quality qualification that opens doors for you into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's keep pushing to make trades not just a viable option but a sought-after career path. Tradies are cool. Let's make sure we get the next generation on board and keep pushing tradies along. We need them to keep Australia going.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to our youth, they are the future leaders, and members of parliament and all those across Australia want to see our youth do well. Sadly, some, as I mentioned in my maiden speech many years ago, go down the wrong path, leave school, get bored and get involved in crime. A number of years ago in Victoria, we had a number of youth gangs getting up to hideous crimes—home invasions, carjackings, stabbings, you name it—and we still do today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had an inquiry, which I was chair of, and the inquiry was called 'No-one taught me how to be an Australian'. That actually came from a young South Sudanese leader, and that's why we used the name. A person who appeared before that inquiry was Les Twentyman OAM. Les, for those who don't know, is an absolute legend when it comes to supporting youth, and Les told me—and I'm a former police officer—'Jason, if you want to help the youth, the only way is early intervention.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Morrison government, we put a program in place, and I actually was very proud as the assistant minister of home affairs to put this program in place. It was called the Safer Communities Fund for high-risk youth. I had three criteria. Firstly, it was to keep young people in school who were about to fall out of the education system, and, whether it was staying at school or making pizza ovens, I didn't care what it was, as long as we could get them to stay in education. Secondly, if they left school, it was about having someone, a group or an organisation to wrap their hands around them and provide training and education to get a job or to go back to school. Thirdly, it was that those who have been incarcerated, rather than walk out into the hands of another gang, walk out into the hands of someone who's going to support them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a delegation that went over to America, and we met with gang members who had spent many years in jail whose role, when young people walked out of a police station, was to basically say, 'You're going down the wrong way. We want to help you and change your life.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We put in place a program which invested $120 million, targeting youth between the ages of 12 and 24—high-risk youth—which supported 133 organisations, of which 30 per cent were from the Indigenous community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You'd think it would have been an absolute no-brainer for the Albanese Labor government to just roll over this program, but, to my shock and horror, the Labor government has completely cancelled this project—this amazing, grand scheme. So many people who are social workers with the skills we need to help young people no longer have a job. The sad reality is that the parents who finally had some hope for their kids, their children or their young person, or whatever you want to call them, no longer have that hope. But, worst of all, when it comes to young people themselves—and we're talking about thousands upon thousands of young people right across the country—they now have lost that hope and are going down the wrong path. So it is no surprise, when you look at the crime stats in Victoria, that things are, horribly, moving in the wrong way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also point out that this program wasn't focussed on Liberal held seats. In actual fact most of the seats—the large majority—were Labor held seats in areas where there are social and economic issues. There have been cuts in funding to Swan, Indi, Rankin, Parramatta and McEwen, and also one in Chisholm, the eastern Melbourne Migrant Information Centre. I went and visited that centre, and it was so sad to meet the young staff who were about to lose their jobs. As they said to me, they'll get another job, but they felt so bad for the young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the Albanese Labor government to reinstate this funding. It's such a disgrace that it has been cut. I must say I've also had a number of Labor members approach me and say it's a crying shame this funding has been cut. It must be restored to help young people.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  Let's speak frankly: the former Safer Communities Fund program for early intervention for high-risk youth became discredited due to the misuse—some even say rorting—of public funds by the previous government, those opposite. But don't take my word for it. The Australian National Audit Office found that the first five rounds of grants under this program were only 'partly effective and partly consistent with the Commonwealth grant rules and guidelines' and also stated:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Funding decisions were not appropriately informed by departmental briefings and, for the majority of decisions, the basis for the decisions was not clearly recorded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder why? They go on:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Applications were not assessed fully in accordance with the guidelines … 54% of funding decisions did not have a clear basis for the decision recorded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous speaker, the member for La Trobe, continues to push a program that he was personally responsible for misusing. The member for La Trobe hand-picked projects that scored lower than projects with higher scores that had been assessed on their merit. The member for La Trobe has even conceded to 'personally intervening in the selection process'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government, the Albanese government, is a government of integrity. We are providing grant programs that meet the needs of local communities, not Liberal candidates. What is disappointing about the former government's treatment of the Safer Communities Fund program is that there were many incredible organisations doing amazing work to contribute to strengthening community safety. We are working with those organisations. We respect grant processes and we are ensuring that grants programs are transparent and merit based.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community safety is a priority for our government. We have committed more than $182 million from the Attorney-General's portfolio to improve community safety and security across Australia through community-based crime prevention and justice reinvestment initiatives. Justice reinvestment is a key element in addressing the causes of crime in my electorate and in the Northern Territory. More than 30 years after the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, First Nations people remain overrepresented at every point in the criminal justice system. The Australian government is committed to pursuing meaningful change by investing in place based initiatives, led and implemented by First Nations communities and organisations, to help turn the tide of incarceration and deaths in custody.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the Northern Territory, we are seeing these initiatives being developed in Maningrida, Groote Eylandt, Katherine and Central Australia. I have met with local organisations in Darwin and Palmerston to drive the process and develop a range of elements to address the causes of crime. Work continues on a youth hub near my electorate office in Darwin. That represents one of the components of our response, working in partnership with the NT government and community organisations. Indeed, it was my No. 1 priority in the previous term to make sure that the funding was there and allocated to address these issues. The Albanese government is committed to supporting local communities to strengthen community safety, to provide alternative pathways for young people who are at risk of being engaged in criminal and antisocial behaviour and to support activities aimed at improving the engagement of at-risk young people in education and work-ready programs, decreasing antisocial behaviour or engagement in criminal activity and increasing positive community and family engagement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government recognises the need for national coordination and collaboration on law enforcement matters. The Police Ministers Council, comprising police ministers from every state and territory, has been re-established. It provides a forum for national coordination and collaboration to achieve improved social policy outcomes and ensure the safety and security of Australians. This is a forum focused on achieving real, tangible outcomes to keep the community safe. Indeed, it was critical in progressing work on the National Firearms Register, which has been a significant improvement in the work of keeping our people safe.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="291387" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  When I came into this role, one of the first groups that came to see me in my office was from Toowoomba's Garden City Mosque. This is a facility that has suffered arson twice. It has been burnt down twice, and they came to ask whether there any way that the government could provide any help around keeping this facility secure while it was being built. I had an interest in this. During my time in the Middle East, I'd built a couple of mosques, so I understood what their concerns were. I asked about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there was this great fund, the Safer Communities Fund. It addressed exactly the needs of this community, and it was no surprise. This was a simple request: could we help with CCTV cameras, lighting and secure fencing. This is the sort of stuff that is quite obvious when you're dealing with community safety. I'm very happy to say that we were able to secure the funding for that mosque. It's built today and all those outcomes from the Safer Communities Fund are there. They're being used. They're making the place safer. They're doing exactly the job they were supposed to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were others across our community who benefited as well. CatholicCare had a great program helping kids, particularly Indigenous kids to the west of Toowoomba, stay in school. They had this great boxing program. I go to a similar one in Oakey. It's great to see the young men, in particular, come down in the afternoon, burn off a bit of energy and get a good feed. They go home and have a good night's sleep. They're not out and active at night-time after that. They've used their energy. They've had some great social interaction. It's a great program that's funded under the Safer Communities Program. I could also tell you of the work done for our Yazidi community. It's helping them settle after the terrific trauma that they went through before coming to Australia. That work has been funded through this program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, we had this great fund and this program, and then government took it away. The previous speaker's comments were that he had concerns about this fund being misused. If that's the case, then replace it. If that's the case, then keep the intention. That hasn't been done. This has simply been thrown away. It was a $50 million program. We've seen $315 billion of additional spending, and a $50 million program couldn't be kept. We saw $500-odd million spent on the Voice, and a $50 million program couldn't be kept. This speaks very much to the priorities of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a program designed at a community level to acknowledge the concerns of safety from community groups. Everywhere I go in my electorate I hear about this, including from churches. I was at the Wesleyan Methodist church up in Wilsonton Heights. They'd been broken into, as has the community centre down in Wilsonton. They're having to go to extreme lengths to secure their compounds from the frequent break-ins. I recently went to the school out at Oakey. They've had the same issues. Once again, wherever food is stored, there are constant break-ins. The men's shed up there at Highfields, in particular, have some great equipment and it's always at risk of being broken into. There are always little jemmy marks around the side of the door from people trying to get in. These are the people who know that this program is needed. These are the people whom this program was designed to help, and it was helping. In the past I've been able to reach out to those groups and say, 'Here's a way we can help. Here's a way the federal government can help you.' Sadly, my community needs help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the desecration of the Drayton and Toowoomba Cemetery last week. A hundred gravestones were just knocked over and destroyed by three young criminals. They've been let off. I could talk about Queensland's youth crime crisis separately, and I have on multiple occasions. Once again, the community's come to me and asked: 'Is there a way that we can help? Is there a way that we could provide better lighting, better security gates or some CCTV cameras? Is there something that we can do?' My answer, sadly, is that there was a way we could help under the previous coalition government, but that's been taken away because this program does not align with the priorities of this government. Safer communities do not align with the priorities of this government. Additional savings of $315 billion couldn't be made, and a $50 million grant couldn't be saved.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If their concerns about the way it was being run were genuine, they would have introduced an alternative that we could have used, but they didn't. To cry, like the last speaker did, and to make out that there was something about the way it was being run that was the issue is not true. It simply wasn't their priority. I call on the government to bring it back; you've got time. Bring it back. This was a great program. It helped vulnerable community members across the board in my community, as it did in countless others around Australia. It was a good program. We need it, and we want it. The government should show its priority to the Australian people.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  The member for La Trobe's motion usefully reminds us that we do need to recognise and celebrate the work done at the coalface by organisations in our electorates that work with young people. A little over a week ago, in Midland, I hosted the inaugural Hasluck Volunteer Awards. It was a celebration of volunteers, young and old. Many of the nominees work with young vulnerable people every day, and they are truly an inspiration. In my conversations with community leaders, I find there is strong consensus that if we didn't have these excellent services being provided to our young people then many of them would find themselves on a path towards trouble, rather than on the path that they are on, which is a supported one where they are flourishing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion refers to the Safer Communities Fund, which was commenced under the former coalition government in 2016. The member for La Trobe has been here since 2013 and served prior also; he is fully aware of that program. Perhaps he had some input into the design. He certainly had some direct hands-on involvement in his capacity as the then assistant minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are reports that the member for La Trobe was involved in the maladministration of the Safer Communities grants program. Of course, he wasn't the responsible minister—the buck stops with the member for Dickson, who somehow now finds himself the Leader of the Opposition—but the member for La Trobe was certainly caught up in it all. It was some of the worst press we've seen for a government. Here's the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> from 6 May 2021:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The article noted that about 80 projects had money shaved off them so that the member for La Trobe could send $3 million to projects not recommended by the department, at least two of which were, in fact, ineligible. In other words, the member ignored his own guidelines for eligibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the National Anti-Corruption Commission in operation. We have the new Administrative Review Tribunal without political appointments. We are cleaning up after the coalition forgot the importance of probity for a whole decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We create safer communities partly with funding grants to meritorious organisations, but we do that using a process that is fair, above board and not a disgraceful rort. The reason we need to do these things properly is that one of the ways we create safer communities is by leading. We provide a good example. I don't believe in trickle-down economics but I do believe in trickle-down leadership. If our politicians are rorting the system and undermining fairness and due process, it affects every other part of society and, yes, it does trickle down to the youth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has reformed the grants process so that when community groups apply for a grant they can apply knowing that they have the same chance as any other group and are having the same criteria applied. They will know that they will not have to guess that hidden criteria, like whether the member for Dickson or the member for La Trobe think that the application has some political use for their party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now come to the organisations that we celebrate today and recognise with grants, at times, because of their commitment to youth and their proven results. CLAN Midland champions early intervention to improve life opportunities for young people and provides programs and services designed to support and promote happy and healthy families, which creates stronger families and communities. Alnoor Community Language provides a safe and welcoming environment for young people to connect with their community and learn English and many other skills, particularly Arabic. They promote community engagement and encourage young people to reach their full potential. The Ellenbrook Vipers rugby club was well represented at the Hasluck Volunteers Awards night, too, with three club members nominated for awards. This is because their club members are dedicated to going above and beyond for their community. The coaches and club executives have created a supportive and caring community environment for the young people of Ellenbrook.</span>

                  </a>  When you hit a nerve, interjections are what you get! They could ask about phone towers and why the phone tower program this government announced is now before the Auditor-General, and why, in Victoria, 100 per cent of funding for phone towers went to ALP seats despite my community of Casey being the second-most disaster-prone community in the country. But they walk out and don't want to talk about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They could also ask the Treasurer why they cut $50 million from the Safer Communities Fund at the same time the Treasurer committed $40 million to sell the stage 3 tax cuts. We don't have money to keep the community safe but we can find $40 million to sell the stage 3 tax cuts, which have already been implemented. That is the hypocrisy of those opposite. They're happy to preach to us but not to live up to their own standards; we see that time and time again with the Albanese Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community knows the Safer Communities Fund was crucial. Tony Smith, my predecessor, did great work in installing CCTV cameras in our community. In 2013 we got cameras in Healesville, Lilydale and Yarra Junction. I've lived in my community my whole life and I've seen the benefit of these cameras. In 2016 there were cameras put in at Belgrave, Monbulk, Mooroolbark, Mount Evelyn, Woori Yallock and Yarra Glen, and in 2019 they were put in at East Warburton, Upwey, Wandin North, Seville, Millgrove, Montrose, Warburton West and Warburton East—and then more again in Wandin and Upwey. They are making a difference in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been speaking to local law enforcement, who are working with me to get some of these cameras upgraded to make sure our community is safe. There are businesses and chambers of commerce that are working with me that have had break-ins and issues happen in their community, in their stores. There is violence that happens on the streets of some of these towns, and they need CCTV to keep them safe. It gives the police lots of valuable assets. The most important one is deterrence. If criminals know there are cameras in streets and in communities, they are less likely to commit a crime. That means people are safer and that families and loved ones are safer. As the police said to me, it means many young women are safer to walk the streets of our community. But it's not just deterrence, which is crucial; it allows the police to gather evidence to prosecute those who have committed crimes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently spoke with our local police officers, and they shared stories of how these cameras in our community have allowed them to catch criminals—and not just criminals locally. Many of the cameras are catching cars that are coming from other areas into our community. Major crimes have been foiled. Serious criminals have been arrested because of these cameras. The police want them, the community want them and I'm going to continue to work with the community to make sure that we have the most up-to-date technology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Albanese Labor government is telling my community and many communities across our country that these cameras don't matter, that keeping community safe doesn't matter and that having early intervention, with high-risk youth programs, does not matter. They're showing that through their actions. They're showing that by cutting $50 million out of this fund while at the same time putting $40 million into selling the stage 3 tax cuts. Ultimately, governments and budgets are about choices. The choices a government make are all about what they're going to do. They're more focused on politics and on spin than on keeping people safe. I urge this government to reinstate the $50 million and put more into this to keep our community safe. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

For more than 15 years I served communities from Eucla to Karratha and back to Perth. My last position with the WA Police Force was working in the community engagement division. Engaging with the community I serve has always been important to me. I want our community to be safe. I want people in our community to have safe places. For police officers, engaging with our youth is also vital. When I was a police officer, I saw how initiatives such as the Police and Community Youth Centres, PCYC, and the Police Rangers program in secondary schools helped to form fellowship and positive relationships with young people. This helped to reduce crime. There are many community programs that make a difference. The Willetton Youth Centre in my electorate of Tangney helps to make young people feel safe, connected and welcome. The centre provides opportunities for youth to make connections, communicate and feel valued. I saw them learning new skills like music and martial arts.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I engaged with anyone in our community, it was vital that I acted with the highest integrity. As a police officer, I wanted members of the community to trust me. Trust is so important, as it is a part of safety. I'm very proud to be part of the Albanese Labor government, which acts with integrity. The former Safer Communities Fund has been discredited due to the rorting of public funding by the previous government. The Auditor-General found that the grants under this program were only 'partly effective and partly consistent with the Commonwealth Grants Rules and Guidelines' and that 'funding decisions were not appropriately informed by departmental briefings'. This is not acting with integrity. The Albanese Labor government's grants are based on merits, they are transparent and they exist to meet the needs of our local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community safety is a priority for the Albanese government. Since October 2022 the government has committed more than $182 million from the Attorney-General's portfolio to improve community safety and security across Australia through community based crime prevention and justice reinvestment initiatives—for example, the Securing Faith-Based Places grants to improve security at religious schools and preschools, places of worship and faith based community centres. Last month I had the opportunity to visit the Chinese Presbyterian Church in Tangney, one of the recipients of the Securing Faith-Based Places grants. The leader of the church told me how they appreciated the opportunity to improve their safety and security. It must also be said that this grant was awarded through an open, competitive and merit based process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former police officer, I also believe in the value of working together. In 2023, my colleague, the Attorney-General, the Hon. Mark Dreyfus KC, MP, re-established the Police Ministers Council. The former government disbanded the Ministerial Council for Police and Emergency Management. The Police Ministers Council brings together all police ministers from every state and territory, as well as the Australian Attorney-General, to coordinate and collaborate on a national level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This forum was critical in progressing work on a national firearms register. This led to a National Cabinet landmark agreement in December 2023 to implement a national firearms register. This is the most significant improvement to the Australian firearm registry management system in almost 30 years. This will help keep our community and our police officers safer, and the involvement of all police ministers and police commissioners was critical to achieving this outcome. Integrity, trust and transparency will work together to achieve real outcomes. These are the values I held close as a police officer and, now, as your member of parliament. I'm proud to share these values— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Safer Communities Fund and to highlight the fact that Labor has ripped $50 million out of that fund. For those at home who don't know what the Safer Communities Fund does, on a practical level it provides safety for your community. Councils and local community groups can apply for funding for practical things that work on the ground—things like security cameras and lights. I'll speak to you while thinking about my former occupation as a police officer—a beat cop, a detective and a prosecutor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These small applications in rural and regional areas are so important for police officers to do their jobs. You have cameras on every corner in cities and metropolitan areas, but in the regions we need this money to keep our communities safe as a deterrence factor and also so the police and law enforcement agencies are able to do their job. I'll give you a practical example. Kempsey Shire Council applied for CCTV under this and they received $300,000. There's a crime spree in South West Rocks. One of these cameras can pick up the car coming out of the town so that they know who the offenders are. That is from one camera. I had a meeting at South West Rocks recently. Some might consider it a small, sleepy coastal town, but over 300 people attended that crime forum, along with the police.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of those people understand how important it is to have this Safer Communities Fund there. They know the application of the funding that has gone into their community, and the police are on the same level as the community. We need this. We need this to do our jobs. But it also does keep the community safe. Kids are walking home after sport safe. It starts to get dark at five o'clock in winter. The lights and cameras there keep them safe. It's deterrence for those who are thinking of committing offences, and we have seen a drop in the rates of graffiti, malicious damage and destruction of community property because of this investment into our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition recognised that. But now $50 million is being pulled away because it was considered waste and to have not been properly implemented.</span>

                  </a>  We should be here, supporting our regional communities and putting back that $50 million. You've just implemented a whole heap of new public servant jobs. In fact, it's the largest-growing employment area in Australia. Why don't we look after our people in the regions? Why do the people in the regions always have to suffer? Another example is Coffs Harbour, which received $900,000 to put up desperately needed lighting in and around the area. It has worked incredibly well. If we didn't have that—there's already increasing crime on the ground—one can imagine how much more the police resources would be stretched.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the Albanese government and the Prime Minister: come outside and have a look at our regions. Talk to the people on the ground. Talk to the people who have implemented the programs for youth through this Safer Communities Fund, like those in Bellingen and Kempsey, where it actually makes a difference on the ground, because it is led by people on the ground and not by bureaucrats in the bubble in Canberra. That's where the problem lies. Mr Albanese, come and visit us in the regions, and I'll show you how it works.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I'm pleased to speak about this motion dealing with empowering youth and reducing crime—a motion straight out of the Liberal Party playbook. They prey on people's fears and try to scare and divide people into voting for them. They are boring and predictable, the original one-trick pony. The motion has no regard for facts or community. It is as sickening as it is repetitive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the member for La Trobe who brought the motion forgot it was his party that rorted the Safer Communities Fund under the supervision of the now Leader of the Opposition. Almost half of the total funding under this program was diverted from recommended merit based projects to projects in target coalition seats to buy votes. The Auditor-General found that funding decisions 'were not appropriately informed by departmental briefings'. Now the member for La Trobe wants to be taken seriously on a motion about community safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Give me a break! I heard no cries from the member for La Trobe when his leader and the rest of the Liberal Party tarnished the reputation of the Safer Communities Fund and sacrificed community safety for short-term political gain. The member for La Trobe has admitted that he personally intervened in the selection process to prioritise projects in Liberal target seats over communities that actually needed the funding. These are the people that we're supposed to believe care deeply about safety in our nation. Unlike those opposite, the Albanese Labor government acts with integrity and takes our responsibility to community safety seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 22 October, we've provided $182 million to improve community safety through community based preventive and justice-free investment initiatives. Importantly, all this funding has gone to communities that really needed funding, because, in stark contrast to those opposite, our government runs transparent and fair grants processes. We serve the Australian people and make positive differences in communities right across the country, while those opposite serve themselves only.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the government implemented faith-based places grants to ensure that Australians can continue to safely practice their religions. This $50 million investment provides funding for security guards and upgrades to faith facilities and helps to protect Australians of faith from religious intolerance. In June this year, the Attorney-General announced funding of $13.57 million for state and territory Police Citizens Youth Clubs and Blue Light organisations. This program focuses on young people at risk of becoming involved with criminal and antisocial behaviour. It is cheaper to divert than to incarcerate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember, it costs around $900,000 or a million dollars per year to keep one young person in custody. Diversionary activities improve young people's engagement with education and work-ready programs and foster family and community connections. From someone whose partner has worked in this area for 30-plus years, I can tell you that engagement with education is the key for people that might get into trouble. It helps reduce recidivism rates and is yet another example of this government's fair dinkum commitment to community safety. It also highlights the approach of early intervention and supporting young people so that they do not take those wrong turns. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite won't now acknowledge the value of these initiatives because, as we know, they are not serious about community safety. This motion is all about scaring the Australian community and taking them for mugs. Those opposite love mugs—they've still got plenty of those black mugs! But, if they really cared about community safety, maybe they wouldn't have disbanded the Ministerial Council for Police and Emergency Management, the Commonwealth's foremost body to engage with the states and territories on keeping Australians safe in their homes. We've reinstated this body, which has already proved its worth, supporting work on the implementation of a national firearms register—practical help. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the member for La Trobe were serious about community safety, you would think he might have raised his concerns about national knife law reforms with his own party before bringing his sound-and-fury motion to this parliament. The measures in this motion were promised by the Liberal Party back in 2010. I could give the member for La Trobe the benefit of the doubt and assume he genuinely did not find the time to raise this issue with his colleagues during his nine years in government—or we could recognise this motion for what it is: a reflection of the shameful record of those opposite, prepared to exploit fear for their short-term political gain, rather than doing the right thing by the community. It is another shallow and cynical political attempt to scare Australians, in spite of the Albanese Labor government's actions, which are all about promoting community safety and harmony. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cheaper medicines have been a win for patients. They've been a win for their hip pockets, for their health and for the wider health system. When meds are cheaper, people are more likely to fill out their scripts and they're more likely to take their medication. In other words, compliance improves dramatically, and there is evidence to back that up. When they take their meds and compliance improves, it's a virtual cycle that spins up—avoidable presentations to emergency departments do not occur. I've seen this time and time again: numerous patients admitted to hospital because they had simply run out of money to take their medications. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2020-21—just to give you an idea of the scale of this issue—314 million prescriptions were provided to 17 million Australians. We know now that almost one million Australians take five or more meds a year. That's polypharmacy. It's not necessarily a good thing, but it is the reality we live in. So, for many Australians, taking their medication is a really significant hit to their hip pocket, which is why we have, since the day we took office, focused on making medicines cheaper for Australians and, in doing so, improving compliance and reducing the number of presentations to emergency departments. In July of the year we formed government, 2022, we lowered the PBS safety net threshold. In October that year we reduced the price of 2,000 brands of medicines. In January last year we delivered the largest price reduction in the 75-year history of the PBS. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The PBS, or the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, is Australia's national formulary—a list or directory of all the medications we have to provide to the Australian people, all of which have been robustly and rigorously tested and come in at a price point that is not going to bankrupt the country. This PBS is a legacy of the Chifley government. He actually had to take it to a referendum in order to get it done. But the PBS now is a gift to our nation, and it has allowed more and more Australians to receive cheaper meds. When the Liberals left office—after 10 years, I might add—a general med script was $42.50. In that interval they could have reduced the price of medications for Australians. Instead, they didn't. We came in and we brought that down by $12.50. Now a general script is no more than $31.60 for medicines on the PBS. But, if you're a pensioner or concession card holder, you'll pay no more than $7.70. We froze those prices in the May budget such that, for general patients, that price of $31.60 per script will last until the end of next year and, for concession patients, it will go on for another five years. We've frozen those costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only that—we've also, after some resistance from the pharmacy sector, introduced 60-day scripts. Sixty-day scripts are really important for the one million Australians who are taking five or more medications—in other words, patients with chronic diseases, who are going to be taking these drugs for a lifetime. We introduced this in September last year for 100 medications. A second tranche came in in March this year for another 100 meds, and in September this year it will be another 300 medications. I want to go through what that means for some patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the topic of diseases, we often think of diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, but in fact there are a host of rare diseases. There are around 7,000 rare diseases that collectively affect two million Australians, both adults and children. One of those diseases is amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a very rare disease. It affects less than 2,000 Australians per year. In my 26-year career, when I was practising, I've only ever diagnosed it once in a patient. This was a patient who presented late, which is the norm. We have made Onpattro, a medication for a hereditary type of amyloidosis, available to Australian patients. This is a game-changer drug. It can actually slow the disease down, preventing the development of further neuropathy or cardiomyopathy, which can lead to heart failure. It has improved the lives of Australians. It is a rare disease, affecting about 55 patients per year. Those patients would otherwise be paying close to $650,000 per year for this drug, but they will now be getting it for $31.60 per script. These infusions, which they take every three weeks, are an absolute lifesaver. That is what having cheaper medicines means for the Australian people.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  I thank the member for Higgins for drawing attention to this very important issue. We are very lucky in this country to have a national medicines policy which should guarantee all Australians equitable, timely, safe and affordable access to a high-quality, reliable supply of medicines and medicine-related services. Unfortunately, though, the medication system in this country is too complicated. It's too slow and it's insufficiently responsive to the needs of Australians. I would also note that, for many Australians, medications are still too expensive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Drugs are approved in Australia after having been assessed by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, who together determine the comparative health gain. This assessment includes looking at the magnitude and significance of drugs' effects—their safety, their cost-effectiveness, their affordability in the absence of PBS subsidies, their predicted use in practice if they are licensed, and the financial implications of that use. The process then involves commercial negotiations between the government and the drug suppliers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that the TGA and the PBS are not working as well as we need them to. We have chronic shortages of hundreds of medications in this country, including some antibiotics, diabetes medications and HRT. Just this week operations are being cancelled around the country because of a shortage of intravenous saline. In a country surrounded by salt water, we have a shortage of saline! I'm also hearing from palliative care physicians who are frustrated by ongoing shortages of morphine, which are impeding their care of dying patients. This is a system which is not working as well as we need it to or as well as it should.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is good that this government has passed legislation which has lowered the safety net for medication prices for many Australians. The government has also passed legislation which has enabled 60-day prescriptions of medications, and prescriptions of up to 12 months after a single visit to the GP. That and the limited price increases that we've legislated in this term of parliament are really important measures for the many Australians who are dealing with severe cost-of-living pressures at this point in time, but we also have the fact that we need new medications. It still takes years to get a new medication from initial application to approval in this country. We know that the PBS operates within a finite budget and that the inclusion of new, often expensive medications is a perennial strain on its resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we all appreciate that the government has to ensure value for money in approving and licensing new medications, its systems are often a frustrating barrier to access to new and innovative therapies. Equity of access is a concern, especially for those with rare diseases which often mandate high-cost, low-volume therapies. As a doctor and a medical researcher, I experienced the frustrations of this system for many years, and I felt them along with my patients and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November 2021 the parliamentary health committee inquiry documented the need for urgent improvement of the health technology environment in Australia. It described how we need greater transparency around medicine approvals and funding, clarity around how we define cost effectiveness and a commitment to consideration of and engagement with alternative models for funding of the system.</span>

                  </a>  The review into the health technology assessments in this country has now been gathering dust on the minister's desk for some months, and I don't have any confidence its recommendations are going to be enacted in this term of government. It's extremely disappointing and frustrating for all in the sector because we need this government to tell us how it plans to develop specific funding mechanisms and policies supporting the expedited approval of high-cost, low-volume treatments for medical conditions. Clinicians and researchers deserve an improved framework for ongoing health technology assessments, and this should include a commitment to research and development and to greater innovation and adaptability within our regulatory bodies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The PBS should provide affordable access to essential medicines for all Australians, but its processes are fraught with challenges. Regulatory delays, cost-effectiveness assessments, budget constraints and negotiation complexities all contribute to the difficulties faced by pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers and patients. We have to address these challenges through streamlined processes, enhanced transparency and flexible approaches to cost-effectiveness. The government needs to ensure our PBS can continue to evolve to meet the evolving needs of all Australians, and we need the government to act now and to demonstrate vision, decisiveness and effectiveness. Australians deserve no less.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  Cheaper medicines mean more money in the pockets of Australians and better health outcomes, particularly for people with chronic conditions. The Albanese government recognises this. Since coming to government we have significantly increased the co-payment for medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Affordable health care is in Labor's DNA because we understand that good health is pivotal to people doing well and living a full life. The PBS scheme was established by the Chifley government. The coalition opposed it, just like they opposed Medibank and Medicare. The Albanese government is building on the great legacy of the Chifley government. Since coming to government we have approved extra funding for 227 new and amended listings on the PBS. In my electorate of Corangamite, cheaper medicines are playing a crucial role in easing cost-of-living pressures for individuals and families. As of 30 June this year, the total patient savings in my region was nearly $2.5 million and the number of reduced cheaper scripts was just under 200,000. When medicines are more affordable, people can manage their health without sacrificing other essential needs, such as food, housing and education. This balance is especially important for those with chronic conditions who require regular medication.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the many life-changing and life-saving drugs is Koselugo. Selumetinib, also known as Koselugo, will be included under the PBS for the first time to treat symptomatic, inoperable, benign nerve tumours in children two years old and over with neurofibromatosis type 1. NF1 is a rare genetic disorder affecting about one in 3,000 Australians. Individuals with NF1 commonly have tumours that cause symptoms such as headaches, pain and disfigurement and that lead to other complications, significantly impacting quality of life. Koselugo works by blocking certain proteins involved in the growth of tumour cells. This medicine is invaluable to the 170 children who are expected to access it each year. It significantly improves quality of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without the subsidy, families may well pay around $146,000 per year for treatment. This is well beyond the reach of most families. On the PBS, they will pay no more than $31.60 per prescription, or $7.70 if they have a concession card. It's worth pointing out that under the Albanese government the maximum cost of a prescription on the PBS was lowered from $42.50 to $30 in January, the largest cut to the copayment in the 75-year history of the PBS. This has delivered about $20 million back into the pockets of Australians each month. And, since the Albanese government introduced 60-day prescriptions, more than 600,000 scripts have been brought into play, saving patients an estimated $5 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be noted that the coalition tried unsuccessfully to block this legislation, which was a nonsensical move when it has benefited so many Australians. All in all, by year's end, Australians will have saved more than $250 million on the price of their medicines, with even greater savings to follow later this year. It is easier now to see a doctor for free, with more bulk-billing services available since the Albanese government tripled the incentives that doctors get to bulk-bill pensioners, concession card holders and children under 16. Doctors in GP clinics in every state and territory have increased the availability of bulk-billing since the $3.5 billion investment came into effect on 1 November. More that seven million pensioners and concession card holders, as well as five million families with children under 16, are eligible for the higher Medicare payments. Together, these patients account for three out of five visits to the GP. Thanks to the Albanese government, a GP in one of the major cities will now receive 34 per cent more in Medicare payments to bulk-bill a standard 20-minute consultation with an eligible patient. These measures are delivering vital cost-of-living relief, ensuring Australians do well. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  This is yet another motion brought in by a Labor member pretending as though everything good that is in the nation has happened since May 2022. If they spruik something often enough and loud enough, eventually, I reckon they're going to start to believe their own talking points. I reckon they're going to start to believe that everything prior to May 2022 was bad and that they are responsible for the sun coming up every morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with this motion is that this is the government which almost sent our pharmacists broke and which almost sent our country chemists, in particular, to the wall. We all remember—I know the member for New England and the member for Flynn well remember—when our white-coated warriors were in the public galleries. They were outraged because the pharmacy agreement had not been signed. It took those members and the Nationals, in a coalition opposition, to bring the government to heel, to bring the government to account, to actually get an accord signed and to get a better deal for our country chemists. Hundreds of country chemists are the only frontline people in those rural communities, in those regional communities and, particularly, in those remote areas of Australia that, but for the chemist, would not have a frontline professional looking after their health needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We so often hear those opposite talking about bulk-billing, yet bulk-billing rates have dropped 10 per cent under this Labor government. I speak on my shadow portfolio role here, but I well remember, during COVID, what the former member for Flinders, as the Minister and Aged Care, did to make sure that vaccinations went into the Pacific. Furthermore, during that time, over 94 million telehealth consultations were made through Medicare to 16 million patients, and there were 857 new medicine listings on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme since 2019. That is delivery. That is action. That was done by a coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, don't you come in here and pretend as though all is new and you're the only ones who are doing anything about medicine. In fact, the truth is, and if your talking points reflected the reality, it's quite the opposite. Labor are failing on the medical front. Labor are failing when it comes to rural communities and their health needs. You only have to look at their 60-day dispensing changes—changes which were very much going to send a lot of country chemists to the wall, and it was the Pharmacy Guild and the National Party, in coalition, who belled the cat on this very ill-thought-out policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, we all want cheaper medicines, but, if it comes at the cost of the only health professional in town, the good old country chemist, that friendly health professional who provides the only form of upfront health care for many of those rural communities, then that doesn't improve regional health outcomes. That policy would have sent many rural community chemists bankrupt. Look at what we did during the pandemic, where, according to the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, we were ranked second in the world for pandemic preparedness, and much of that was in the area of health. That was because of the policies of the former coalition government, a coalition government now maligned by those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We always hear them talking about a trillion dollars worth of Liberal Party debt. I'll remind those opposite, the Liberals are in a coalition with the Nationals. What did we get for the money we spent? We saved tens of thousands of peoples' lives. We saved millions of jobs. During the pandemic, 1.1 million jobs were created and, if not for that assistance that we provided, those jobs would have been lost. We would have seen unemployment queues. We would have seen queues at the Salvos and at St Vinnies longer than we saw during the Great Depression era.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor comes in with these motions, talking about the PBS and talking about what they've done, they forget about what was done during those years that we were in government. They forget about the life-saving drugs that were put on the PBS for cystic fibrosis, cancer and leukaemia. They forget about all those people, particularly those throughout our regional communities, who have to travel further for medical treatment. 'When in pain, catch the plane' is often the case. They should reflect on that and they should make sure we have better regional health outcomes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300122" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:53</span>):  I am very fond of the member for Riverina, and I think he does, under the circumstances, in a nonpartisan sense, an exceptional job of representing his constituents by and large. I never cease to be frustrated, though, when honourable members come into the chamber, clearly paying very little attention to the substance of the motion at hand and seeking to score some cheap and poorly articulated political points at the expense of the substance of the matter that we're seeking to discuss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality here is that Scott Morrison and his Liberal government set the conditions for our country to face an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis. This is best exemplified, as the member for Riverina very honestly points out, by the trillion dollars of Liberal debt that Scott Morrison's government stacked up on behalf of the Australian taxpayers and, ultimately, left for generations of Australians, regardless of where they live or their socioeconomic circumstances, to pay down. They had nine years, nine budgets and nearly a decade in government, and across the course of that decade they did not deliver a single budget surplus. They had nine budgets and, despite the mugs crowing about their economic prowess, they did not manage to deliver a single surplus; in fact, there were nine budget deficits. Nine times they spent more money than they saved. So the country is left with a trillion dollars of Liberal debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We face a series of very unstable international economic conditions, and the Australian people have been suffering. People in my own electorate of Hawke have been facing very challenging household economic conditions. Our government, the Albanese Labor government, can't fix everything. We don't pretend for a second that there's a silver-bullet solution to these challenges that will ultimately set aside this history of reckless fiscal management by the Liberal Party as well as some very challenging economic conditions, but there are some things that we can do that will serve working people, in terms of taking some of the economic pressure off them at a household level while, at the same time, meeting our broader social obligations and, indeed, ambitions as a community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our cheaper medicines policy is a great example of this. This is a policy that is specifically designed to ensure that working people can affordably access the health care that they require. It takes economic pressure off households. They now effectively get twice as much medicine for their money, so the price of medication is halved. Indeed, it takes pressure off our broader public health infrastructure, in that it ensures that people have ongoing health support and that they can afford to pay for their medicines. Accordingly, they don't find their health conditions slipping over time while they try to save money and try to make very difficult considerations about the priorities in their household and family budgets. When their health care goes on the backburner, all of a sudden we have an epidemic of very serious health issues that have been poorly managed for, frankly, unreasonable economic reasons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This policy is specifically designed to do two things: take pressure off working people and their household budgets and, at the same time, ensure that we have a healthy community that is able to access the medicines and the health care that it requires in order to remain a healthy community. It doesn't matter where you live in this country and it doesn't really matter what socioeconomic circumstances you come from. In this regard, the cost-of-living crunch has been unusual.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I well understand that the member for Riverina considers himself—with some credibility, I think—a warrior for regional people, but he is not the only regional MP in this building. Indeed, I assure you that the Nationals are not the only party that represents regional people. I represent regional people as well, and I can tell you right now that regional people all across my electorate have been overwhelmingly positive on this policy. In pharmacies in all our small towns people can now access the health care that they need, and they're doing it at half the price they were previously. We know that our regional health infrastructure is under pressure, and this is one approach to taking that pressure off.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="157125" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  Today I rise to talk to you about a promise the Albanese Labor government made to the Australian people—a promise to make medicines cheaper—and how we are delivering on that commitment. Labor went to the election pledging to bring down the cost of medicines for Australians. I am proud to say that we are fulfilling that promise. As of 30 June 2024, over five million Australians have saved more than $456 million on their prescriptions since January 2023. This isn't just policy on paper; it's real, tangible relief for households facing rising living costs. This is the kind of support that only a Labor government can deliver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since July 2022 the Albanese Labor government has implemented crucial reforms to make medicines more affordable for everyone. In July 2022 we lowered the PBS safety net threshold. This means that people with high medical needs reach the point of getting medicines free or at significantly reduced cost faster than before. In October 2022 we reduced the price of 2,000 brands of medicine, and just three months later, in January 2023, we achieved the largest price reduction in the 75-year history of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Under our government, no-one pays more than $31.60 for a PBS-listed medicine, while pensioners and concession holders pay no more than $7.70. We know that every dollar counts for Australian families, and this is making a real difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In September 2023 we introduced 60-day prescriptions for 100 medicines, which was expanded to 184 medicines by March 2024. This reform allows Australians with stable ongoing health conditions to collect two months worth of medicines with a single prescription. This saves them time, cuts down on trips to the pharmacy and, importantly, saves money. To give you an idea of the impact, from September 2023 to June 2024 in Pearce alone, there have been over 52,000 60-day scripts filled, easing the burden on thousands of patients. And we are not stopping. In September 2024 we will roll out the third phase of the 60-day prescription reform, which will expand to include nearly 300 medicines. Additionally, in our most recent budget we froze the price of PBS medicines at $31.60 for general patients until the end of 2025 and $7.70 for concession patients until the end of 2029. This is another way we're delivering essential cost-of-living relief while ensuring all Australians have access to the medicines they need to stay healthy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to touch on another key part of Labor's commitment to affordable health care. The PBS is a vital lifeline for millions of Australians, and Labor is committed to making it stronger. Since coming to government, we've approved funding for 227 new and amended listings on the PBS. These listings include life-saving and life-changing medicines like Trikafta. Trikafta is a revolutionary drug for people with cystic fibrosis, and we have expanded its PBS listing, making it available to children aged two to five. Cystic fibrosis is a devastating disease, and providing access to Trikafta earlier in life can make all the difference. This expansion is expected to benefit an additional 330 children each year. Without subsidy, this drug would cost families over $250,000 per year, but, on the PBS, they will pay no more than $31.60, or just $7.70 if they hold a concession card. This is the kind of meaningful impact the Albanese Labor government is delivering.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to reflect on the opposition's approach. The opposition has consistently opposed every measure we've introduced to make medicines cheaper, and they have a track record of making health care more expensive. By the time those opposite left office, the cost of a PBS script had risen to $42.50. But we reversed that trend. We cut the maximum cost of a PBS script from $42.50 down to $30. This is the largest reduction in the cost of medicines in the 75-year history of the PBS. In Pearce alone, from January 2023 to June 2024, there were almost 207,000 reduced co-payment scripts filled, saving patients nearly $2.5 million. These savings matter. They mean less financial strain for families and better access to the care that they need.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our goal is simple: to make sure every Australian can afford the medicines that they need without worrying about the cost. These reforms aren't just numbers; they are about people—people who need access to affordable health care and life-saving medications. </span>

                  </a>  I move this motion on behalf of agriculture, on behalf of the farmers and graziers and rural communities in Australia that rely on the Great Artesian Basin as their principal water source. The Great Artesian Basin is unique. It is the only one of its kind on the planet. It is the world's largest underground potable water source. It covers an area of something like 1.7 million square kilometres over three states and one territory in Australia. It is estimated to carry 65,000 cubic kilometres of water. It is the eighth wonder of the world, if you like!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we all know, there was a proposal by Glencore, through their subsidiary company CTSCo, to pump 330,000 tonnes of hypercritical CO2 fluid into the precipice sandstone water aquifer of the Great Artesian Basin. This was a trial at Moonie, in Central Queensland. If it was given approval, they intended to take that to industrial scale, and, according to their EIS statement, pump 730 million tonnes of hypercritical fluid into that precipice sandstone water aquifer. The precipice sandstone water aquifer is the deepest and best water aquifer of the Great Artesian Basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When this proposal was examined by the Queensland environment office, they found that what would happen is the pH value of the water would be lowered and the water would become acid. As such, it ran the possibility of eroding the geological formations down there and releasing heavy metal such as lead and arsenic into the water. It also found the precipice sandstone was not a confined aquifer. In fact, if you live in Central Queensland, where I come from, all the way along the Central Queensland escarpment is the precipice sandstone. That geological feature, those enormous great big white cliffs—that's where they come out of the ground, and that is where the precipice sandstone springs are. That's where all that water in the springs originates from, deep underground. The further south you go, the deeper it gets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland government, in their wisdom—and kudos to them—moved some legislation to effectively ban carbon capture storage in Queensland. One of the problems we've got is that this issue is not finished. We need to make New South Wales, South Australia and the Northern Territory follow suit. As I said, the Great Artesian Basin covers all those states and territories, and it's really important we recognise the waters of the Great Artesian Basin for what they are—a geological feature that is extremely important to agriculture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a Senate inquiry into the whole issue, and it made two recommendations. One:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that states and territories consider a legislated ban on CCS activities across the GAB to ensure this important natural asset is uniformly preserved.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last year the National Party moved amendments in the lower house to enable the water trigger through the EPBC Act to put some protections around the waters of the Great Artesian Basin in respect of carbon capture storage. These amendments were defeated by both the government and the Greens. It is absolutely outrageous; it is staggering hypocrisy from the government and the Greens not to support those amendments. The Great Artesian Basin is the world's largest underground potable water source. It deserves to be protected at all costs for future generations and for agriculture. Australia is the driest habitable continent. It is absolutely outrageous that somebody would even suggest we use it as a suppository for industrial waste.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  The Albanese government welcomes the member for Flynn's moving this motion. I've got to say it's wonderful to see his newfound interest in the environment and Indigenous cultural values. We certainly agree that the issue of carbon capture and storage is important, and protection of the Great Artesian Basin is very important also. But this motion just highlights that the coalition has been all over the shop on this Glencore proposed Carbon Transport and Storage Corporation project. They're a hopelessly divided rabble on this issue. The Liberals have been against the Nationals, the Nationals against each other, and they're against each other individually and personally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that the member for Flynn is calling on the government to do something that's premature, because there's no matter before the government to oppose or approve. If there's anyone he should be taking this issue up with, it's the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. That's because we know that, during the former Morrison government, she was the environment minister when a delegate in her department decided the issue was not a controlled action—that is, it would not require approval under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, leaving environmental assessments to the Queensland government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might add that the Miles Labor government recently announced a ban on carbon capture and storage in the Queensland section of the Great Artesian Basin. I noticed the member for Flynn thanked them for it. I would have thought that he would have put it in the motion because it was a decision that was made a while ago. So it just seems that this motion is largely redundant and little more than virtue signalling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back to the Morrison government—before finalising its advice, the environment department sought feedback from several ministers at the time, including the then National Party leader and minister for regional development, the member for New England; and the Nationals member and then Minister for Resources and Water, the member for Hinkler. The Nationals leader's office didn't respond, while the then Minister for Resources and Water actually endorsed the department's decision. In a recent statement, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to this consultation, pointing out to her Nationals comrades that they were 'fully aware of the decision at the time'. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">No objections were raised and in one case, a minister's agency wrote back in agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a complete about-face and a sign of disunity, the current leader of the National Party, the member for Maranoa, and his party room have been publicly bagging the Deputy Leader of the Opposition over this. In May the Nationals leader said the decision was wrong and said this: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It was a desktop review done by the environment minister at the time, Sussan Ley, and she didn't get it right. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It wasn't on her radar to the extent it should've been.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The trouble is, before the election, the Nationals were all for the project, and after the election they were as well. In June 2022, in an interview on the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> program, the Leader of the Nationals, whose electorate this project is in, said this: </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… you can look about 60km west of where I'm sitting now and carbon, capture and storage has been implemented on a coal-fired power station from Millmerran. That's the investment we—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">the Morrison government—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He even posted on his Facebook page the following statement: 'Proud to be investing $5 million in carbon transport and storage company at Millmerran'—contrary to the motion here today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now the Nationals want to pretend they have nothing to do with the project and are trying to walk both sides of the street on this. Last year, the minister for the environment took our first tranche of the nature repair environmental legislation bill before the House, and the Nationals moved an eleventh-hour amendment, basically having a bet each way on carbon capture and storage in the artesian basin. But do you think they gave the government a chance to even look at it? Absolutely not. It was never going to pass.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So just what is the Liberal and National parties' position on this? You just have to look at the Leader of the Nationals' <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> interview just over two years ago, when he was spruiking the project because it not only protects gas but also protects 'our coal industry as well as carbon capture and storage', contrary to the motion here today. That's the position of the leader of the National Party two years ago on a number of projects, and before the election and after the election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And here we have the member for Flynn putting a motion before the chamber today that is completely at odds with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and his own leader. This is nothing more than the Liberal and National parties duking it out in the Federation Chamber. I'll be surprised if the Liberal Party hasn't got someone in to back the member for Farrer, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, against this. What a circus the coalition is on this—a complete fiasco.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the member for Flynn. Comrade, if you want to come over here and support us and be on this side of the chamber, I'll issue you with a Labor Party membership ticket. But don't stay over there, because they're full of disunity. You can't work out what you want. You're fighting amongst yourselves—fighting internally in the National Party. Have a yarn, by the way, with the Leader of the Nationals and see what his true position is.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr JOYCE:</span>
                  </a>  If you look at the actual chemical make-up, you've got carbon dioxide and H2O. CO2 and H2O will give you carbonic acid, which, of course, is H2CO3. With that, you get the acidification of water at a pH of about 3.75 at 25 degrees Celsius. Then we have a capacity for leaching of materials, especially with, as my good colleague has said, things such as arsenic and lead coming into the water. We might also note—this is why we have a concern—that, once the pH of water gets below around 6.5, cattle are less likely to drink it. In fact, they get a condition called acidosis. Acidosis means their capacity to convert feed is dramatically reduced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western areas, what we see is that the Great Artesian Basin underwrites and underlies the country and economy. It also underwrites the capacity for towns to exist out there. When I was living in Western Queensland, in Charleville and Saint George, running out of hot water was never a problem; running out of cold water was. That's because the water temperature was between 30 and 100 degrees Celsius. We also note that this goes right back to the Pliocene era. Some of the water that comes up is between thousands and two million years old. That's when it was absorbed by the Great Artesian Basin. That is a completely different epoch. It's from an epoch from way before the land bridges. It's an epoch when Australia was a lot wetter. We're borrowing from a time millions of years ago. For a political and policy view, and for a tiny little fraction of that two million years, we're willing to put it all at risk. We haven't got another two million years to fill up the Great Artesian Basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Great Artesian Basin is about 3,000 metres at its deepest. That's over 9,000 feet. It is vastly deeper than Mt Kosciuszko is high. This is the biggest aquifer in the world. I find it peculiar that we're willing to put it at risk. Putting swindle factories and wind towers everywhere—that's okay. Knock over whatever you want. Painting fields photovoltaic black is okay; you can do that. Strip clearing 28,000 kilometres for transmission lines—that's okay. Tearing up environmental laws to put all this in place—that's okay. Changing the pH of the Great Artesian Basin—that's okay. But, if you graze country in certain areas, that's a criminal offence. If you take down timber in certain areas, you need a logging permit, or it's a criminal offence. This goes to show the conversion and confusion that has happened because of this cult-like activity surrounding climate policy. It is a cult. It has left logic behind and become a cult.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Something the previous speaker, the member for Blair, brought up, was: 'What are we talking about?' I put it back to the member for Blair, if he's still there after the preselection. If he thinks everything is fine, then he should be able to change the legislation so that anything pertaining to the Great Artesian Basin becomes a controlled action. It's not a controlled action at present, and that is the issue. For some unknown reason in this cultish behaviour, we've left the Great Artesian Basin out as a controlled action, so it should come in as a controlled action under the EPBC Act. There are so many thing I would want out of the EPBC Act, but I'd actually want that in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I'd like to thank the member for Flynn, because he has been the champion of this. If it hadn't been for his [inaudible] approach within party rooms and his absolute dedication to this cause, I genuinely believe this issue would not have been addressed. The changes we have seen in Queensland and at the federal level would not have happened. There are few things a person does in their political career which they can hang their hat on, and I think the member for Flynn, who is sitting beside me at this moment, can talk in his annals about what he did to save the Great Artesian Basin.</span>

                  </a>  I take that interjection by the member for Kennedy. We're heading into election season and there's a bit of an odour of desperation wafting across the room from those opposite. When it comes to grasping at straws, the member for Flynn has a walk-on role in the next <span style="font-style:italic;">Wizard of Oz</span> remake.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is criticising a decision made not by this Labor government but by a delegate of Sussan Ley when she was the Minister for the Environment in the former Morrison coalition government—unbelievable! I remember seeing a photo of the member for Flynn holding up a sign saying, 'Save the GAB!'—the Great Artesian Basin—but it looked incomplete to me. What it should've said was: 'Save the GAB from my own environment minister!' This motion has nothing to do with the Albanese government. Labor supported the Senate to conduct a review into the matter, and earlier this year AgForce, too, sought a review of the decision made by the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition's delegate in the federal court. The federal court dismissed the case, so I won't comment further on such matters, but I will say that there is no decision before the government to oppose or reject. I repeat: no decision before the government to oppose or reject. What the member for Flynn is asking the Albanese government to do is not possible and would be unconstitutional. The time to review the decision has long passed. If there's one thing those opposite have shown in recent weeks, though, it's that deadlines aren't really their strong suit.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the state of the Liberal and National parties these days? It's just one stuff-up after another. First they announced some half-baked nuclear policy—the most expensive electricity on earth—then they couldn't get nominations in on time for local government, and now the member for Flynn is bringing a motion critical of his own deputy leader. He should've just handed it to her in the party room. The truth is those opposite are an absolute mess. They couldn't organise a rock fight in a gravel pit, really. They've got no alternative vision for this country, and this impotent motion by the member for Flynn is supposed to distract people from the train wreck of his political party.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Farrer isn't the only person the member for Flynn is criticising with this half-baked motion. He's also attacking the Leader of the National Party, the member for Maranoa, who not only supported the project but talked it up publicly. The member for Maranoa said that he was 'proud to be investing up to $5 million in the carbon transport and storage company at Millmerran'. The member for Kennedy knows that Millmerran is in the member for Maranoa's own electorate; he knew what he was saying. Then, once the Nationals leader realised it was going south, he changed his tune and immediately threw the deputy opposition leader under the political bus. He said:</span>

The Leader of the Nationals talks a lot about character in this place, but he doesn't have the character to face his constituents and say: 'I'm sorry. I got it wrong.' Instead, he ducks for cover and throws the deputy opposition leader under the political bus. This is indicative of the even bigger backflip that the entire National Party is doing on the environment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the member for Flynn is proud to announce to the world that he's a climate change denier. He has openly suggested that environmental progress furthers the 'socialist agenda'. I am glad that at least this issue has brought out the environmentalist within him. I look forward to seeing him vote with the government on further environmental and climate reforms in the future. He can start by calling up his friends in the Senate and demanding they vote for our Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill 2024. It's time for them to support these measures and say yes to the benefits of the strong and independent Environment Protection Australia. It's time to agree with tougher penalties for those who break environmental laws. It's time to recognise that better environmental data will inform future planning and decision-making, and it's time to give the green light to more programs, projects, policies and actions to create a nature-positive Australia, instead of moving ridiculous motions like this. This motion is nothing but a cheap political attempt to cover the fact that the Nationals stepped in a Liberal bear trap and should never be taken seriously again.</span>

                  <a href="HX4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  The member is obviously a member of the old Country Party, as I myself am. We've reconstituted that. It's called the KAP, and we invite him to join us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one of the most extraordinary decisions I have ever witnessed in my life. It took me three weeks to actually believe that this had been agreed to by a Liberal-National government or by any government on earth. One-fifth of this nation is only occupied by human beings, kangaroos, wallaroos and birds because of an underground aquifer. There are maybe 30,000 windmills pulling that water up from under the ground and putting it in troughs so that areas that had never seen a kangaroo in 30 million years suddenly saw kangaroos and birds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other side of the coin, I went to the anti-wind-farm rally at Chalumbin. They're putting a wind farm right beside the jungle. I'm in favour of wind farms. Hughenden is the peak spot in Australia. The professor who was giving an address to the 200 people at the rally said, 'What is happening here is that our beautiful nature wonderland is being replaced by an industrial wasteland.' There's only 20 years—there's 15 years in the windmills and 20 years in the glass. Is anyone going to go out there and replace that rotting disgrace and aberration in the environment? No. The answers are very clear. If you put that poison into the Great Artesian Basin—and the speaker before last spoke very well on the dangers of doing that—you will contaminate the artesian basin and one-fifth of Australia will be sterilised. Every single form of life will die. It's costing us $8,000 million to send some electricity out to Mount Isa. It will take a hell of a lot more than that if you want to pipe water out to any of these areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cattle and sheep that have been removed by this imbecilic place that I have to come to, thanks to the people of Kennedy—God bless them. This place has removed three-quarters of the entire sheep population. For 200 years the nation's income came from wool, and in 1990 we got Keating. The Labor Party was formed to deliver arbitration, not just to the working class, or the employee class, but to the farmers. Keating came in and withdrew the arbitration. He undermined the arbitration for the employees, I might add, but he withdrew the arbitration for the 276,000 farmers. He only did one industry: wool. The rest of it was done by the National Party. They deregulated every single industry. The history books will condemn and spit upon that political party. And I was in that party when it was done, to my shame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me go back to the artesian basin. Some 10 million tonnes of CO2 was being pulled out of the air by the cattle and sheep that were in these areas before deregulation. Due to a combination of various antifarming actions, the deregulation of free markets and all that sort of rubbish—ideology—10 million tonnes of CO2 is going into the atmosphere that was previously being absorbed by the cattle and sheep. A moo-cow might put on 100 or 200 kilograms a year, and that of course is carbon pulled out of the air. With the removal of trees by the industry—Queensland has removed more trees than any other state in recent memory to make way for glass. Trees have been replaced by glass—is this a lunatic asylum or what? Put the cattle and sheep back and that's 10 million tonnes. Put the trees back and that's another 10 million tonnes. That's 20 million tonnes a year, which is more than the combined efforts of both parties in this place over the last 10 years. And it also makes us wealthy. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  Today I wish to recognise the remarkable team of volunteers at Mudgee Museum. This dedicated group works tirelessly to preserve and share the rich history of the Mudgee area through an impressive collection of over 60,000 items. The museum's collection is housed in several historic buildings, including a mid-19th century hotel, an early-20th century church and a replica slab hut.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently visited the museum to discuss the federal volunteers grant it received. I'm very pleased this funding will support the purchase of an overhead scanner, which will significantly streamline the digitisation of their extensive archives. The museum is operated by a team of over 30 passionate volunteers from Mudgee Historical Society. The hardworking executive of the society includes president Barry Wells, vice-president Sue England, treasurer Thelma Meers and secretary Heather McCormick. I met with them, as well as Barry's wife, Fay, on my recent visit.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of our community I acknowledge and thank all the Historical Society members and museum volunteers for their hard work, passion and dedication. Thanks to their efforts, the museum continues to expand and its exhibits go from strength to strength. The vital work of the Historical Society in operating the Mudgee Museum preserves our local and national heritage, and the museum itself has become a well-known and much-loved destination and drawcard for visitors to the region and locals alike. Congratulations to the team at Mudgee Museum.</span>

Throughout the 1990s Elliot served as the general manager of the Julalikari Council Aboriginal Corporation, in Tennant Creek, where he worked tirelessly to improve the lives of people in his community. His leadership and advocacy led him to win the seat of Barkly for the Labor Party in the 2001 election, and he served two terms. In 2005 he was appointed the Minister for Local Government and Housing in a Labor government in the Northern Territory. He resigned from the portfolio in 2008. There are many things he left, and, in recognition of his significant service to Barkly, Tennant Creek and the Northern Territory, he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 2015.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the first decisions of President Donald Trump in 2017 was a blanket ban on refugees from seven countries that he described as 'a source of radical Islamic terror' from entering the US. More than 60,000 visas were revoked, and protests erupted at airports across the country. I was at Chicago airport that week as a reporter, amid chaos and confusion as people with green cards returned home from holidays or business trips and were detained and prevented from re-entering the US. Recently the former president has threatened to restore the ban, which was shelved by the Biden administration, and include individuals from Gaza, saying:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  Yesterday, on 18 August 2024, I was proud to attend a solemn and profound Vietnam Veterans Day service at the Torrens Parade Ground in my electorate of Adelaide. Yesterday marked the 58th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. We collectively paused to remember the service and sacrifice of the 60,000 brave men and women who served in the Australian Defence Force during the Vietnam War, and of course their families. We also acknowledged the service of our Vietnamese veterans who served alongside Australians during the war, many of whom have made tremendous contributions to our local community after migrating to Australia following the war. I'd like to congratulate the South Australian veterans community, particularly Mr Ian Smith, who is the chair of the RSL state branch Anzac Day Committee for organising such a respectful, wonderful and well-attended event yesterday.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  I rise today to highlight a remarkable initiative taking place on the streets of Kooyong: our community's English Corner. This regular event is a shining example of grassroots community engagement in which Chinese migrants and local residents come together to exchange languages, culture and friendship in a warm and welcoming way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For our Chinese newcomers, English Corner offers an invaluable opportunity to practise their spoken English to build their confidence and to integrate more fully into Australian society. At the same time, it provides our local residents with the unique chance to learn Chinese and to gain deeper insights into the rich cultural heritage that our Chinese community brings to Kooyong. But this initiative is about more than just language learning. It's also about fostering mutual understanding, breaking down barriers and promoting social cohesion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In coming together in this way, we're not just sharing words. We are building bridges and we are creating a stronger and more unified community. I commend the organisers and all of the participants of the Kooyong English Corner for their dedication to making our home a place where diversity is celebrated and cultural exchange thrives. Their efforts are a testament to the power of community driven initiatives in enriching our society.</span>

I know too well the deep scars that conflict leaves on people's lives. Last week, we reflected on a moment that profoundly impacted my community. Three years ago, Kabul fell to the Taliban, leading to the collapse of Afghanistan's republican government. In the weeks that followed, Australia and other coalition partners worked to evacuate over 123,000 people from Kabul airport. Watching those desperate scenes, as people scrambled onto flights to safety, left me in tears. Countless others were not as fortunate and were left behind, forced to make the dangerous journey into Pakistan or Iran.</span>

For those who supported democracy, returning to Afghanistan means facing arrest or even death. As we commemorate this occasion, let us thank the men and women of the ADF who helped evacuate Kabul and let us remember those left behind, enduring the harsh realities of the Taliban rule.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">John has been involved in the parish for decades. He is always seen to be going above and beyond to positively impact those around him and provide valuable assistance to the parish schools office. John paid a strong role in creating the parish's out-of-school-hours care service at the primary school, a service that is still running and incredibly popular. He's also offered valuable expertise to the parish schools office on numerous occasions. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice, translated from Latin, means 'for the church and Pope', and the medal was established in 1888 by Pope Leo XIII. It is the highest commendation from the Holy Father to members. In a ceremony at the Coffs Harbour parish, Bishop Greg Homeming presented John with the award. This is a strong testament to John's continued dedication and invaluable services to the church and the community. I'd like to thank and congratulate John on receiving the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice medal for his efforts towards the church. I know John's wife, Jenny, his daughters, Gina and Diana, and family are very proud of him.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  Today is known as Equal Pay Day. This is a theoretical day, basically 50 days into the new financial year. This is the number of additional days Australian women must work to earn the same as men did last financial year, on average. These are the stats, and it's a tangible way to demonstrate what we need to do to close the gender gap. This is exactly what the Labor government is working on. One of the ways we're doing this is through our historic expansion of paid parental leave. From 1 July, parents will receive 22 weeks of paid parental leave up from 20. This scheme will continue to expand each year until it reaches 26 weeks in 2026. That's when families will receive around $24,000 in government-funded paid parental leave. This means more support for parents to take out time to care for their newborn child. Labor's changes will benefit around 180,000 Australian families each year. In my electorate of Swan, nearly 2,000 people received paid parental leave last year. That's 2,000 families and children in Swan that benefited from greater choice, security and flexibility from balancing work and care. Working shouldn't be a barrier to caring, and parenting shouldn't be a barrier to working.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  On Saturday, our community came together to clean up the graffiti which has been such an unfortunate feature of Pennant Hills, Thornleigh and Normanhurst. Local residents, shop owners and police agree that the level of graffiti across these communities in unprecedented and that something had to be done. I convened a graffiti-busting army with Alister Henskens MP and Councillor Sallianne McClelland. I want to give a special shout-out to Roger Norman and his team of Mark Hedges, Ross Warden, Colin Brunker and Duk-Soo Park from Turramurra Rotary. Roger organised the logistics of the clean-up. He trained our volunteers. He's truly an inspiration. Together with the volunteers, we donned gloves and masks and got to work fixing the ugly mess that the vandals made.</span>

I give a big thanks also to Maggie Morris, the Thorp family, Isabella Chen, the Musico family, Joseph Habkouk, Rose Gray, Isabella Skelly, Robert Joscelyne, Karen Awad, the Riley family, Emilie Boshoff, Gaby Samiya, Astrid Pickup, Surin Jung, Jasmine Mazidi, Sahana Kaur, Keira Rodrigues, Tina Faber, Deborah Egan-Wiggins, Maria Ferraro, Urmila DChuna, Brian Norman, Ryan Bridcutt and Stephanie Brown.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  Each of us is a leader in our community. Current events around the world and our multifaith communities in Hasluck and around Australia serve to remind us of the need to model religious tolerance. Everyone in our society has the right to express, further and celebrate their religious and spiritual beliefs. It's the duty of this parliament to ensure that, within this cultural sphere, which includes religious expression, every person feels and is demonstrably free to follow their own personal spiritual journey. These rights always need to be managed and balanced against other rights, of course—freedom of expression and the right to gender equality, for example.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the minister's speech, which we often repeat at citizenship ceremonies, we highlight that Australia is one of the most successful multicultural societies. This is true, but it is not a given. It is something we need to continually strive for, protect and defend. A commitment to multiculturalism includes a commitment to a nation that is multifaith. It involves both respecting and valuing each and every religion, be it Chrisitanity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism or a hundred others. It involves respecting beliefs which eschew a deity, which are now held by many people. If we understand each of us are on a journey, and we turn our backs on dogmatism and intolerance, we have the best chance of preserving the multiculturalism that has made Australia the great place it is today. Here, we need to lead on this. </span>

I extend my respects to all those who attended the Nerang RSL service and acknowledge the service and sacrifices made by veterans of the 10-year Vietnam conflict. On Long Tan Day, we honour those who served in the Vietnam War and their families for their service and sacrifice to our nation. I acknowledge the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Queensland, their support group and the men's shed for the work they do to support Vietnam veterans in my community. I thank president Peter Handy, secretary Peter Cameron OAM and president of the Gold Coast sub-branch Andy Bryson for the moving service, and I thank all the veterans and their families who attended. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For some time, 2,500 former national servicemen have been campaigning to receive the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, for which a serviceman must have completed a minimum period of 181 days, either continuous or aggregated, unless killed in active service, wounded in action or captured and later released or escaped. Before now, this has not applied for those suffering in silence with PTSD. But, very recently, Vietnam veterans who did not serve for 181 days have been able to apply for the medal if they can prove they were wounded in action, supporting it with medical evidence. I want to thank Senator Paul Scarr for his advocacy so that this change might be made. I finish with this: as his eyes filled with tears, I pinned the RVCM medal to the already full lapel of Mr John Crane, Vietnam veteran, to properly acknowledge his service and sacrifice to the Commonwealth. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  On Saturday 3 August, Ipswich was a sea of colour for Queerswich 2024. Queerswich is Ipswich's own pride festival and a fun family day celebrating inclusion, diversity and the local LGBTQIA+ community along with their families, friends and supporters. It's a terrific event with a carnival atmosphere, featuring live entertainment, art shows, markets and even a puppy pageant. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The event is the brainchild of proud Ipswich locals Julie Herbert and Rachel Vickary from Pink Flamingo Productions, who were concerned about the high rates of suicide among young people struggling with their sexual identity, prejudice and the lack of events for the local community in Ipswich. That's why they organised the first-ever Queerswich last year. I was very proud to open last year's event and this year's event and to have a stall there. It was a huge success last year, and this year was even bigger than ever. I want to recognise Rach and Jules for their vision, passion and courage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This important event provides a safe space to celebrate and raise awareness of the community and their achievements. It contributes to a vibrant, healthy and sustainable local community in Ipswich and puts our city on the map. I want to congratulate local organisations and businesses for getting involved and supporting the event. I'm proud to be part of a party, a government and a local community that value equality and diversity and respect for all people. As Allan Roebuck said in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Local Ipswich News</span>, 'After all, love is love.'</span>

I believe, given where I'm from, I have some contributions to make. In my maiden speech I said: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… the electorate of Nicholls is, I believe, one of the most successful examples of multiculturalism in the world. People from all over have made their way to this region, often coming with nothing, and they have made extraordinary lives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had waves of migration from southern Europe, even going back to prewar. An Albanian mosque was built in Shepparton in the late 1950s. There are a number of different faith groups and a number of different nationalities that come and are part of the bigger story which is Greater Shepparton. Often they came because there was work available. I also said in my maiden speech:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My observation as a member of this community is that we seem to do better when we celebrate each other's different cultural identity but moreover embrace each other's humanity, the humanity being a stronger bond between us than any divisions that tend to be amplified by race, gender, sexual orientation or religious view.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this multiculturalism, this great success that we've had, is threatened if we call each other names such as 'racist' and make baseless allegations and if we don't get the security settings of immigration right.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  I was taught at school that Australia's highest peak was Mount Kosciuszko. Wrong! If you include the Australian territories, Big Ben on Heard Island is actually Australia's highest peak. Not only that; it's an active volcano. I my electorate of Boothby, I recently attended the showing of the documentary <span style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ce </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Fire</span> about the beautiful Heard and McDonald islands, situated 4,000 kilometres south of the Australian mainland. The title <span style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ce and Fire</span> refers to the spectacular images of Big Ben spewing red-hot lava onto its pristine snow covered slopes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These islands are UNESCO World Heritage listed and are home to penguins, seals, petrels and albatross, and the surrounding waters are home to many unique cold-water, deepwater fish and marine life. The 2024 South Australian of the year, adventurer Tim Jarvis, also spoke to a packed audience about the impact of climate change on the islands, the rapid shrinking of glaciers and the impact of the changing environment on the wildlife.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In July this year, Minister Tanya Plibersek announced a massive expansion of the protected waters around these islands—an extra 300,000 square kilometres of ocean. This is part of the Albanese Labor government's '30 by 30' commitment: 30 per cent of the land and 30 per cent of the ocean to be protected by 2030. I'd like to thank the Pew Charitable Trusts for their work of publicising the importance of protecting these islands and Minister Plibersek for protecting our wonderful environment.</span>

The facilities were built more than 40 years ago and the buildings are reaching the end of their useful life. They are too small to accommodate the growth in population over four decades and do not meet contemporary building standards, such as those for disability access. The cramped changing room facilities are run down and inadequate to cope with the growth in popularity of women's sport. There is very limited storage space for sporting equipment, and the clubroom and kitchen facilities require modern refurbishment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A redevelopment of the facilities needs to be placed on the agenda now—sooner rather than later—since it takes several years to complete the architectural design and building plans, conduct community consultation with stakeholders and secure the necessary capital funding. For a project of this scale, it will require the local, state and federal levels of government to cooperate. I look forward to working proactively with the local community and the City of Joondalup to put this important project on the redevelopment agenda, starting now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  A big day in Australia is 1 July. On that day in 1932 the Australian Broadcasting Commission began its first radio broadcast. On this day in 1949 Johnny Farnham was born, as was Missy Elliott in 1971. In 1979 on this day Sony sold the first Walkman, and on 1 July 2024, Australians saw a much-needed cost-of-living relief package, with historical Labor tax cuts. Supporting Australians during the difficult times that we inherited from the Liberal Party is the centrepiece of the Albanese Labor government's time in office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1 July, every single Australian taxpayer, 13.6 million Australians—46,000 in my own electorate of Lyons—got a tax cut, with an average cut of $1,279 per person, and I'm happy to say that the majority of taxpayers got a bigger tax cut than they would have under the Liberal Party. That means that a hardworking family with a household income of $120,000 between mum and dad will receive an additional $45, according to their payslip, each week, every week, forever. On top of that, we are expanding on last year's energy relief package, which ensured every household in Australia got support with $300 off energy bills. Of course, we provided extra support through the Paid Parental Leave scheme, and the Fair Work Commission brought down new award rates.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  I wish good luck to everyone competing in this weekend's Risdon Cup. The 60th anniversary of the Darling Downs' great rugby competition will take place at Toowoomba Sports Ground this weekend. I bring very sad news: out of the eight teams competing this weekend, there's only one Toowoomba team. In men's A grade, we have Dalby versus Goondiwindi. All the money's on Dalby. But I want to point out the great, the mighty, the fantastic Toowoomba Rangers. I might've played for them once or twice! They came third this year. It was a great turnout. But there is a great chance for Toowoomba this weekend. The Toowoomba Bears, in the women's final, are playing against St George Roma. This is the first time Downs Rugby have played a 15-a-side season in the women's competition. It's been a great competition, a great show of strength for Downs Rugby. We're growing. We're getting better and better. B grade is the most important for some people. It is Dalby versus Gundy—again, with both teams going for the triple. If I go to C grade, Dalby are playing Gatton. This could be three out of three for Dalby if things go bad for everybody else. But, for Gatton, it's the first time in 11 years they have made the final. It's great to see them back up at the top of the table. I want to thank all of the sponsors, particularly RDO, who are getting right behind this event, and everyone who is going to turn up on the day, all the coaches and players, for making this such a wonderful event. I maintain my threat of another run in C grade sometime next year! </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  I stand here today to congratulate the Surrey Park Swimming Club on 120 years of serving our community in Chisholm. Since 1904 the Surrey Park Swimming Club has been playing a vital role in teaching locals how to swim. Surrey Park Swimming Club started with a 100-metre hole in the ground after the excavation of clay for the local brickworks in Box Hill. Now they are the largest swimming club in Victoria and one of the oldest clubs still active in Australia. Surrey Park Swimming Club has survived wars, droughts and a pandemic. They've expanded beyond Box Hill and have opened a learn-to-swim centre and squad training pool on the border of Blackburn and Box Hill South. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many incredible swimmers learnt to swim at Surrey Park Swimming, including Olympians and world champions. The team at Surrey Park Swimming take their commitment to our community really seriously. They donate a portion of each swim school fee to their Community Access Program for Swimming, which is just wonderful. This program provides free swimming lessons to refugees and people experiencing financial hardship. They also provide free water safety talks to local kindergartens, early learning centres and primary and secondary schools. Thank you to the wonderful team at Surrey Park Swimming Club for all that you do for our community. Happy 120 years!</span>

There are over two dozen CWA branches in my electorate of Durack, which provide a space for women to come together, to share stories, to fight and to advocate for our regional communities and to share the odd recipe. In 2018, after WA Labor made significant cuts to regional education and threatened to close Moora college, the CWA joined the campaign to save the school and to reverse these cuts. This culminated in a rally that inspired a magnificent cartoon by Dean Alston. The cartoon depicted a squadron of the 'CWA militant wing' firing scones and curried egg sandwiches at our state parliament—classic Alston! Later that year, I proudly announced that the coalition would provide $8.7 million to fund a refurbishment that saved the college. This is just one example of CWA's successful advocacy for regional communities. In May I attended the Walkaway CWA Mother's Day morning tea and was gifted a copy of<span style="font-style:italic;"> Women of Spirit—a Centenary </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">CWA Stories</span>. I had the great pleasure of it being gifted to me by Mrs Jean King, who is a CWA champion in my area. I have no doubt that their work will continue for the next 100 years. Happy 100th birthday!</span>

On Friday we opened the Surf Coast Highway level crossing ahead of schedule, while construction of the South Geelong to Waurn Ponds rail duplication will soon be complete, meaning many more trains on the line. The Albanese government is also progressing the Barwon Heads road upgrade, with stage 1 completed last year, 12 months ahead of schedule, and construction of the $250 million stage 2 upgrade about to get underway. And we're delivering much-needed recreational facilities, with a new highball centre in Armstrong Creek and indoor aquatic centres for the North Bellarine and Surf Coast. These facilities build on significant federal funding for black spot funding to upgrade dangerous roads, school upgrades, environmental initiatives to protect our wetlands and NBN upgrades to improve connectivity. Then there is our new urgent care clinic, the new women and children's hospital and the new local headspace for Armstrong Creek.</span>

I've known them both since they were little girls, and they've grown up to become inspiring women. Jess won two gold medals, one in the K1 women's and one in the C1, and Noemie beat her big sister in the kayak cross to take out the gold medal. Not only are they wonderful Olympic champions; they are inspiring the next generation of young sportspeople coming through the ranks of Western Sydney. Jess and Noemie Fox have two proud parents: their dad, Richard, who was the Australian coach; and their very own coach, their mum, Myriam. They've been right behind them, as have our whole community; they have been behind these two young women from the very day they started their great careers.</span>

That's where these two women as well as all our Olympians have trained, and that's where our future Olympians are training now. We're so fortunate to have that stadium. I'm glad that in 2019, as an election commitment, I made further investment into futureproofing that stadium for future generations.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  I rise to congratulate Elizabeth Napoli for recently receiving the Volunteer Recognition Award from Gymnastics New South Wales. This award is for distinguished service to the Gymnastics New South Wales community. Liz attended the 2023 Gymnastics New South Wales annual awards night at Doltone House on Sydney Harbour earlier this year. Last year Gymnastics New South Wales had close to 72,000 participants with more than 200 affiliated clubs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteers are the lifeblood of sporting clubs and associations. Volunteers like Liz, who give their time to others, are a huge part of why it is possible for so many people to enjoy sports and develop their skills. Amongst all the volunteer serving the Gymnastics New South Wales community, Liz and four others were chosen to be specially recognised with the Volunteer Recognition Award. It is an exciting time to celebrate the success within gymnastics. The sport has become the third-most popular activity for children in New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Liz is recognised amongst the community as a powerhouse. She manages her volunteer role contributing towards gymnastics for all while also coordinating gymnastics at PCYC Cessnock, helping improve and develop gymnasts within PCYC New South Wales and so much more. Our community is very lucky to have you, Liz. Congratulations again, and thank you for everything you do with the kids all around our area.</span>

Last Tuesday my family and I gathered at Duntroon to celebrate my eldest son William's graduation from the Royal Military College. He has graduated as a lieutenant, and we couldn't be prouder of him. I say a massive congratulations to the entire cohort who graduated last week as well. You have all shown extraordinary dedication, resilience and strength throughout your time at RMC Duntroon and you should all be proud of yourselves for what you have achieved, especially as you enter the next journey of your lives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the year 12s in my electorate and right around the country who are nearing the end of their schooling and are unsure of what they want to do, they might want to think about a career in the Australian Defence Force. Currently there are many opportunities within the Army, the Air Force and the Navy. In the Army there are armoured vehicle crew drivers, in the Navy there are sailors to man the upcoming nuclear powered Virginia class submarines and in the Air Force there are crew working on refilling planes and logistics. It's a great opportunity. You can consider the ADF gap year, where you can just do 12 months and get a bit of a feel for it and travel and meet new friends and develop your skills. But you might just want to apply for four years; it's not a long time. Get onto adfcareers.gov.au.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  Clean indoor air is the missing link in reducing the risks posed by airborne threats like viruses, bushfire smoke and allergens. This pandemic would have had a completely different trajectory had indoor air quality standards been in place, which would have saved lives and livelihoods and maybe even prevented lockdowns. Wiping down surfaces and washing hands is fine if you have a pandemic of gastro, but that's not what we had. Treating indoor air like the water we drink is the key lesson of this pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to launch, with Assistant Manager Ged Kearney, the Chief Scientist's report on clean indoor air. This work was commissioned by Ged with the support of the Minister for Industry and Science, Ed Husic. This report provides the evidence base to keep Australians safe, healthy and productive by treating indoor air in the same way we treat the water we drink.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when productivity is on everyone's lips, clean indoor air is low-hanging fruit. Making the case for clean air with Ged directly to the national science council was a personal milestone for me because my journey into politics was through fighting for masks and clean indoor air for healthcare workers. This report provides the evidence base. The next steps are about implementation, which is essential to our resilience against future airborne threats and to our duty of  care to Australians.</span>

There were 14,500 people, and 5,000 caravans rolled into town. Broken Hill and Silverton were absolutely chock-a-block with people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While they were there, they undertook the Mundi Undi run in their underpants. They raised $68,000 for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. They also set a new world record, with 7,200 people dressed in blue making a map of Australia. The drone footage looks amazing; it's worth checking that out. They also raised $115,888 for Beyond Blue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is now becoming an institution packed to capacity. Mundi Mundi Plains is one of the most sensational places in my electorate. From the lookout, looking towards South Australia, you can see the curvature of the earth looking towards Mundi Mundi. It's beautiful. These people not only experienced the beauty of Silverton, Broken Hill and the far west. They also stopped, on their way to and from, at Menindee, Wilcannia and some of the other magnificent communities that are in the Parkes electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has become an institution. People look forward to it, and it's really good that the visitors to the far west are not only contributing to the economy but are also understanding how wonderful it is.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  When local children's book author Cristy Burne saw me out doorknocking one day in Tangney, she gave me a copy of her latest novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Into the Blue</span>. I cannot think of a better book title; maybe that's because I was once a dolphin trainer. Set at Coogee Beach in Western Australia, <span style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nto the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span style="font-style:italic;">lue</span> is about a child who takes his older brother's camera without asking.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like me, Cristy is a big believer in public education, in the power of reading and in having access to books. Her books all feature some science, along with adventure and big questions about the world and about ourselves. Cristy, who is also a science communicator, says that children are scientifically proven to be the future. I wholeheartedly agree. In my own life, in the lives of my family and in the lives of the many students I have met across Tangney, I have seen how a single book can unlock creativity, innovation, empathy and care. This year's Book Week theme is 'reading is magic'. So are our writers, illustrators, teachers, librarians and, of course, our students.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  After over 42 years of medical practise in the small rural community of Theodore, Dr Bruce Chater OAM has officially handed over ownership of the medical centre in the small town. Bruce has made general practice his life and has assisted countless patients along the way. Dr Chater has been ably assisted by his wife, Anne, who has been the operations manager at the clinic. Anne has been heavily involved in the local Theodore community and was one of the main organisers of the recent centenary celebrations in Theodore. Dr Chater will be passing the baton on to Dr Elizabeth Clarkson, who was born in Moura. Dr Clarkson said the welcoming community and the family orientated culture that Dr Chater has built within the medical practice were part of what attracted her to Theodore.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  If it wasn't curried sausages it was an Indian curry or perhaps a Tongan curry. They were all out at the inaugural Kurri Kurri curry festival on the weekend. I am a true Kurri girl—that's k-u-r-r-i-k-u-r-r-i. It's such a great town, they named it twice! Quite a few years ago now we were kicking around the idea of having a curry festival. I want to congratulate Councillor Rosa Grine and Cessnock City Council on making the Kurri Kurri curry festival a reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At first, people were a little bit nervous about how many might show up. Well, over 3½ thousand people turned up over the weekend to learn how to make curry and to have a great experience with their family. They also coined the arts festival, along with the curry festival, but I know that the curry was the main game. Chef Gavin came along to teach people how to make a curry. There were belly dancers and fire twirlers. There was someone who carved a swift parrot and a regent honeyeater out of wood with a chainsaw, and I guarantee it was slower than the real thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say a great big thanks to our community, who turned out to the newly refurbished Col Brown Rotary Park in Kurri Kurri for the curry festival. It's a little sample of how great curry is, no matter whether you like it hot and spicy or whether you like it mild.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  The Cronulla Sharks were founded in 1963, and this organisation has spurred Sutherland shire to have the most rugby league, touch and Oztag female players in New South Wales. In 2022 the National Rugby League appropriately added an NRLW team to the Sharks, but the change rooms and their facilities are diabolical. Opposition teams need to use change rooms across the road, having to cross at the lights and walk into the stadium, past all the punters and the public, to enter. They have no proper showers or toilets and no private spaces for physiotherapy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other electorates are being looked after. The Sea Eagles at Brookie have been promised $36 million. There's $40 million going to the Tigers at Leichhardt Oval and a whopping $300 million to the Penrith Panthers. The Cronulla Sharks NRLW have had no federal funding—nothing. They just have a suburban ground that's used for all their home games as well as the men's home games. Under a Liberal government, I will fight for the Cronulla Sharks NRLW team to have adequate training facilities. That is something only a Liberal government will deliver for the female players in the Sutherland shire.</span>

I really appreciate the time and effort taken by those who have contacted my office to share their concerns and personal experiences with me. I stand with the people of Wallsend and support their calls for a properly resourced post office that meets customer and community needs not just now but into the future, and I call on Australia Post to invest in their workforce and postal services in Wallsend. They deserve nothing less.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really proud to support the Albanese government's third budget, which sustains the momentum we built in reviving Australia's cultural sector and implementing our National Cultural Policy. Australia's eight national arts training organisations are essential to the development of a skilled and innovative creative workforce in Australia. This group, known as the ARTS8, includes the Australian Ballet School, the Australian Film Television and Radio School, the Australian National Academy of Music, the Australian Youth Orchestra, the Flying Fruit Fly Circus, NAISDA Dance College and the National Institute of Circus Arts as well as NIDA. NIDA and AFTRS alumni have, between them, received 16 Academy Awards, including actors Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving, costume designer Catherine Martin and directors Gillian Armstrong, Warwick Thornton, Phillip Noyce and Jane Campion. The eight schools nurture the talent and build the capacity of the next generation of artists and arts workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was lucky enough to attend a performance by students from each of these institutions at an annual collaboration event not long ago, and I was astonished at what these talented young creatives are capable of. They're people who'll tell our stories on stage and screen for decades to come. The future vitality of our cultural life depends on their imagination and skill. But, sadly, the future of these organisations was left in doubt by the previous government. When we came to government, we recognised that there was a real crisis. Funding for the ARTS8 organisations had declined in real terms. After a decade of wilful neglect, a number of these schools were left at risk of collapse. That's not something that we could allow to happen. I'm particularly proud that the budget provided $115.2 million over the next four years to the ARTS8, with $36.4 million in indexed, ongoing annual funding following that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important organisation that is the treasure of our audiovisual heritage is the National Film and Sound Archive. Its collection reflects our cultural identity, our creativity and our technical achievements. It cares for everything from the 1930s newsreels and vinyl records to digital games and VHS tapes of our best loved soaps. Many of its records are fragile and deteriorating rapidly; many of them are unique and irreplaceable. If they're lost, they're lost forever. Nitrate based film and images are particularly at risk, and the NFSA is in a race against time to digitise them. Some of the defining moments of our history are captured in this medium, including the earliest moving images of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples from as early as 1898; the world's first feature film, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Story of the Kelly Gang</span>, from 1906; film of troops embarking for deployment during the First World War; and the bodyline cricket matches.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NFSA also provides storage for other national cultural institutions. Under the previous government, the NFSA was not adequately resourced to care for these priceless treasures. The 2024-25 budget provided $9.3 million over four years to upgrade facilities for the storage and preservation of nitrate film and images. This will double storage capacity and ensure the preservation of nitrate film and photographs for future generations to access. This investment builds on the $34 million over four years for the NFSA that was allocated in the previous budget as part of a half-a-billion-dollar support package delivered by the Albanese government to rescue our national cultural institutions from the financial crisis the previous government abandoned them to, which had put collections, jobs and our cultural heritage at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget continues our commitments in Revive to First Nations languages. Before colonisation more than 250 First Nation languages were spoken in Australia. Sadly, fewer than that number are still spoken today as a direct result of past government policies to suppress them. Australia has one of the highest rates of language loss worldwide. We want to ensure First Nations languages are spoken for generations to come, so we're investing $53.8 million in the preservation and teaching of First Nation languages. There are many other key areas but these are some of our most important.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  Victorian era art critic John Ruskin wrote in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ornings in Florence</span>, in 1875:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Great nations write their autobiographies in three manuscripts—the book of their deeds, the book of their words and the book of their art. Not one of these books can be understood unless we read the two others, but of the three the only trustworthy one is the last.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the hallmark of civilisation is predicated on the development of arts and culture within a complex society. But all too often governments neglect this critical element of society, instead focusing on the bread and circuses of large sporting complexes—which are important too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure we don't neglect the arts. It's therefore pleasing that the 2024-25 budget provides significant new investment in Australia's art and cultural sector. The electorate of Mayo, my electorate, has a thriving community art scene encompassing music, song, dance, theatre, sculpture, visual arts, painting and poetry. We have over 30 art venues and more than 20 community based art groups in Mayo such as Inkpot Arts, Stirling Players, Yankalilla Youth Theatre, Hills School of Theatre Arts, Stirling Community Theatre, Adelaide Hills Performing Arts Centre, Adelaide Hills Arts, Rockit Performing Arts, Theatre Bugs, South Coast Choral and Arts Society, Fleurieu Dance Collective and Laughing Llama Dance and Drama, just to name a few.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Preserving our cultural history is equally as important as creating an environment for cultural development. A great example of this is in Mayo: the Willunga branch of the National Trust of South Australia, which manages four heritage buildings and runs several programs. One of these programs is the Bassett Boys Schoolroom tour, which provides a unique learning experience for primary school students from reception to year 3 with a range of interactive activities. The activities are undertaken in the state heritage listed, single gabled schoolroom built of local freestone with a slate floor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australia has a long history of supporting the arts. In 1998 we established the South Australian Living Artists Festival, known as SALA, to celebrate visual artists and their work. The annual SALA event, held every August, brings art to the people, creating exhibitions in small businesses, art galleries and public spaces. In 2024 more than 600 venues were involved in the event and more than 9,000 artists participated. In Mayo more than 140 exhibitions took place, and everyone in our community got involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of all the arts, I believe the one that binds us most closely together is that of music. In the words of the great philosopher Plato, 'Music is the medicine of the soul.' Music taps into the very essence of what it is to be human. It can make us laugh, can make us cry or can make us be inspired. Put simply, nothing influences our emotions more than music. Live music venues provide musicians and patrons with the opportunity to share experiences and musicians with the opportunity to hone their art. Such venues encourage socialisation in a world where we are becoming more socially distant through the digitisation of life.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Arts and culture form the intricate cultural mosaic of our nation. Without it we would be soulless, and society would be devoid of any meaning. I very much support this motion and look for this and future governments to make sure that we always invest in art and culture. I applaud the great work being done with respect to funding the arts, and I look forward to the enormous creativity in the future and to what will happen in my community. It is a joy to attend SALA exhibitions and plays and to see young people perform on the stage for the very first time in their lives. I commend the motion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  I thank the member for Macquarie and the government's special arts envoy for bringing on this motion. The creative economy—and I will talk about it in terms of economy first—makes up seven per cent of our total GDP. That means $1 of every $14 is generated in the culture and arts sector. It employs 2.7 per cent of our Australian population. That's 1.5 times the entire population of Tasmania. The arts supports our tourism industry—an industry only slightly less valuable to the Australian economy than agriculture. According to the figures from 2017, almost half of all tourists in Australia engaged with culture and the arts. Coming from the state of MONA, I can tell you that's absolutely true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With that being said, the point of arts and culture isn't just to generate money. The arts entertains us, educates us and, most importantly, provides insight into who we are. Sometimes it makes us laugh; sometimes it makes us cry. At its best, it makes us ask the hard questions of ourselves. The arts provides us a shared Australian identity. It gives us national pride. Australia is the unique fusion of immigrants and of the oldest living continuous culture in the world. That's worth engaging with, and that's encapsulated in our arts sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's for this reason I'm very proud to speak on the member for Macquarie's motion as a member of the Albanese Labor government. Our government is channelling $144.2 million into Australia's cultural sector, we've published Revive, and work is ongoing. $115.2 million is going towards the national arts training organisations. This sector group includes the Australian Ballet School, the Australian National Academy of Music and the Flying Fruit Fly Circus. Some of these organisations are the most prestigious not just in Australia but on the planet. They have trained directors, musicians, dancers and all manner of cultural roles. Thanks to the funding, they'll be doing it long into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no easy way to say this, and I hope I don't bring the House down, but the fact is the coalition government—when it was around—tried to kill Bluey. The ABC is responsible for the majority of Australian children's programming, including Australia's favourite blue dog. But, under the former Liberal government, the ABC were subject to egregious cuts. The Albanese Labor government wants Australian children to watch programs that reflect them and their world. We want programs where kids can see people on TV that look and sound like them. To this end, we are providing $14.5 million to the Australian Children's Television Foundation. This ensures funding security for the ABC for the next five years and reinstates its indexation. We are cleaning up the mess of the former government in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the Australian Labor government allocated $34 million to the National Film and Sound Archive. This year, we're adding on an extra $9.3 million. The member for Macquarie spoke beautifully about the importance of this archive. It covers everything from Australia's earliest films of the 1890s up to video games from the modern era, and it's not an easy task. Many of the films on file are nitrate based film, need to be kept in the cold and the dark and require very careful handling. The funding will go towards extending and improving their storage facilities. This means, as a nation, we can retain pieces of heritage like the first moving pictures of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, the first feature film and footage of our troops heading abroad in the First World War. We all remember the story before the last election of the National Gallery not even having enough money to keep leaks from the roof hitting the floor. It was just incredible. These repositories of the Australian story were just starved for funds under the former government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government is also providing $5.2 million to support our orchestras in the territories. It is hard to believe that, over the 10 years of their government, the Liberals did not provide a single cent towards these orchestras. The magic of music and, particularly, classical music can just be such a driving force for change when kids hear classical music for the first time and hear it in their own communities. Almost half of all the music played by these orchestras is Australian in origin, with eight per cent by First Nations composers and 28 per cent by female composers. We've got a lot of work to do and a lot of mess to fix up, but we're well on the way to telling Australian stories, and that's what we do.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  I thank the member for Macquarie for this motion and for visiting my electorate last year to attend my arts and culture roundtable in her capacity as the Special Envoy for the Arts. The roundtable was an opportunity for my local arts and entertainment community in Indi to learn how to benefit from the government's national cultural policy, Revive. Regional Australia deserves to play a leading role in our national arts scene after so many years of being an understudy to the arts scenes of the major cities. The roundtable was attended by more than 70 people from across Indi, including the border's Flying Fruit Fly Circus. I've long advocated for the Fruities, as they're affectionately known, and I was thrilled to see the circus school awarded $7.3 million in the government's most recent budget. Such an investment in our regional performing arts sector is a testament to the incredible work of the teachers, students, parents and supporters of this unique regional arts institution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indi has a highly engaged and talented arts community with performers, visual artists, musicians, teachers, museum curators, creators, producers—the lot. They attended that roundtable last year. What we heard from them was that our thriving arts and cultural scene is held back from realising its creative and economic potential because investment in the arts has been in decline for many years. We heard loud and clear at the roundtable that regional Australia needs investment in cultural infrastructure and arts precincts to attract the best talent to perform and exhibit their work in local galleries, theatres and public spaces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Benalla Art Gallery has a creative vision to be a world-class gallery on the shores of Lake Benalla, close to the heart of the CBD. Benalla is known for its incredible street art festival that transforms the regional city into an open-air gallery of murals by world renowned street artists. I was delighted that the Benalla Art Gallery was awarded more than $2.9 million in federal funding in May this year towards its redevelopment and expansion under the Growing Regions Program. I was pleased to support and advocate this funding, which will go a long, long way to bringing to life the vision of the Friends of the Benalla Art Gallery, who also attended the roundtable last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having lived in Wangaratta for more than 35 years, I have very fond memories of the annual Wangaratta Festival of Jazz and Blues. With the prospect of the festival wrapping up, a new community group rallied to take the festival forward, and, by May this year, more than $40,000 in crowdfunding had been achieved, demonstrating the appreciation and fondness the community has for this iconic festival. Then, in June this year, the festival organisers secured more than $52,000 from the federal government's Festivals Australia program. That's a significant boost to support a free daytime outdoor stage and interactive art installation. Funding from both the community and the federal government will breathe new life into and revitalise this fantastic festival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Artistic expression and participation in and enjoyment of cultural institutions, festivals and events enhance the prosperity of our regional communities and the health and wellbeing of people of all ages. Regional arts communities provide inclusive spaces for young creatives to express ideas, explore their passions and learn more about themselves. Even as a young adult, I learnt much about myself from joining a local theatre company, the Wangaratta Players. I learnt that, when it comes to the theatre, my role is really just to make up the numbers! While acting may not be my forte, I am enthusiastic about supporting local theatre, from the professional productions of Wodonga's Hothouse Theatre to the community run extravaganzas of the Mansfield Musical and Dramatic Society. Thank you to all the passionate community members who work to protect and promote the arts in our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Indi I am proud of how our regional communities showcase our unique arts and cultural experiences. I look forward to continuing to work with the member for Macquarie and the government to strengthen regional Australia's arts sector and protect our cultural heritage. Regional arts communities like those in Indi are waiting in the wings, ready for their turn to truly shine in the national spotlight.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144732" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  Thursday morning was one of the more peaceful and inspiring starts to the day that I've had in this place. I had the opportunity to enjoy a beautiful performance by the Canberra Symphony Orchestra's string quartet. The Canberra Symphony Orchestra are one of the great classical music groups in my electorate, and they will celebrate their 75th anniversary next year. I was pleased to join the Minister for Finance, Senator Katy Gallagher, to announce an extra $4.1 million for the Canberra Symphony Orchestra in May, before the federal budget, with an ongoing $1.3 million each year as a sustainable funding model. It has long been known that the CSO have been chronically underfunded, particularly over the 10 years of the previous government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have seen firsthand the work that the Canberra Symphony Orchestra undertakes. They are known for their diversity of programming, performing work by 45 per cent Australian composers, eight per cent First Nations composers and 28 per cent female composers, which is more than any other major orchestra in Australia. They also run important community programs such as Painting with Parkinson's, Diverse abilities and Heartstrings as well as programs in aged-care homes around the territory. These are critical community music events around Canberra, and they really help people to experience the music. I am so proud to have the Canberra Symphony Orchestra in my electorate, and I'm proud to be part of a government that is adequately funding them and allowing them to thrive. I'm also proud that our government has committed $5 million to revitalising the Gorman Arts Centre in my electorate, which is a vibrant hub for Canberra artists and will be celebrating its centenary this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Minister for the Arts is passionate about ensuring that Australia's arts sector gets the funding it needs to thrive, and our special envoy, the member for Macquarie, is certainly leading the charge for better recognition of community arts. With these passionate members of parliament at the helm of our arts policy, it's no wonder that the Albanese Labor government has invested heavily in the local arts sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For arts to continue to thrive in Australia, we must have a strong arts workforce. This means investing in national arts training organisations, including those within the ARTS8 group. This includes the National Institute of Dramatic Art, the Australian Film Television and Radio School, NAISDA Dance College, the Flying Fruit Fly Circus, the Australian Ballet School, the National Institute of Circus Arts, the Australian National Academy of Music and the Australian Youth Orchestra. Our government values these organisations because of the importance of nurturing and recognising young creative talent to be able to get Australians to see Australian stories on screen and on the stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last budget, the Albanese Labor government committed an additional $115.2 million over four years to support the long-term financial sustainability of the national arts training organisations. A further $36.4 million in indexed, ongoing annual funding will be provided to these organisations from 2028-29 to ensure the viability of these organisations well into the future. This will allow for future great Australian talent like ARTS8 trained Oscar winners Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving to study and develop their craft.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our most recent budget also provides $14½ million to the Australian Children's Television Foundation to support the creation of Australian children's screen content. As a parent of small children, I know how important that is. The foundation has funded iconic television shows like <span style="font-style:italic;">Round the Twist</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Dance Academy</span>. Continuing to provide funding to the foundation means that children in Australia will be able to watch shows that have been created just for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our treasury of Australia's audiovisual heritage, the National Film and Sound Archive, has also received funding in the most recent federal budget. Their collection goes from film from the 1890s to digital games and reflects our cultural identity and technical achievements. The Albanese Labor government has provided the National Film and Sound Archive with $9.3 million over four years to upgrade and extend their facilities for the storage and preservation of nitrate film and images.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Investment in the arts is investment in the cultural preservation and development of Australia, and I'm proud that we're committed to funding it, including right here in my community of Canberra. Canberra is a community that really values the arts, and I was so pleased to make those announcements I mentioned as part of an Albanese Labor government that recognises the importance of arts for every Australian.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="295676" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:10</span>):  I also thank the member for Macquarie for bringing this motion to the House. Arts and culture are important to help build a society that enables the mind to question and stay curious. The arts encompass all aspects of the human condition, from how we eat and how we engage with each other to how we find meaning and value in life. Whilst the natural sciences lead us towards answers to the question of 'How?', the arts seek to explore the question of 'Why?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The arts play a crucial role in my diverse electorate of Fowler. They provide many in my community with a platform to share the richness of their culture. It allows them to maintain a sense of where they are from and encourages them to explore their creative skills as they struggle to settle into a new society. From Serbian and Croatian folkloric dancing to the Vietnamese fan and hat dances, and from Arabic dabke line dancing to candombe at the Uruguayan club, Fowler is rich in cultural celebration, and celebrating our cultures of origin helps open connections between us all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased, therefore, that two of Fowler's arts based projects received the government's four-year investment, namely CuriousWorks and Powerhouse Youth Theatre. CuriousWorks has been investing in and nurturing artists across multiple disciplines since 2005. They provide a space for artists to explore diversity and to see how ideas and identity intersect in our contemporary multicultural landscape. Powerhouse Youth Theatre in Fairfield is the only professional theatre company in Western Sydney. They play a crucially important role in both developing the artists of the future and training the next generation of production and backstage staff. In particular, they are providing a space to encourage culturally and linguistically diverse artists to express their own stories. They stand in the long tradition of allowing complex contemporary issues to be explored through drama and creative expression. For our young people in Fowler, of whom many have come from war-torn countries and are seeking answers to the questions of who they are, this is a vital service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I welcome the investment in these two important arts providers, I want to acknowledge that this is not the end of the journey towards investments in the arts in Western Sydney. Our region faces unique challenges in terms of language barriers, accessibility and financial limitations. I urge the government and the minister to not only maintain investment in the arts in Western Sydney but also look for areas where access to funding may be enhanced. Cost-of-living pressures inevitably reduce the role of individual philanthropy and private investment in the arts. The use of taxpayer money is so important, because it would be hard to imagine some of our amazing institutions, such as our symphony orchestras and ballet schools, existing without this funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken before of rejecting a purely utilitarian approach to public policy. That is why I have called for the government to review the Morrison government's Job-ready Graduates Package. This package has seen an increase in the fee costs of arts degrees in an attempt to shoehorn students from STEM subjects. While we all understand the benefits of STEM graduates and appreciate the higher wages on offer for them, this approach has potentially discriminating implications, given that women are much more likely to study arts degrees—and I did study an arts degree. It fails to face the reality that students choose areas of study that they are good at and are interested in. That's why arts students have continued to enrol, despite the increasing personal financial cost implications. This is a fundamental problem that needs addressing urgently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without investment in the arts and culture, we are at risk of becoming a nation devoid of poets, artists, filmmakers—of which I was one—writers and important voices in how we think about human relationships and ethical questions—questions that often arise from scientific and technological advances. STEM needs the arts if we are to harness the benefits and avoid the pitfalls of advances in AI and medical possibilities, for example.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, the arts are the way that we seek to answer the deepest questions as to why we are here and to find purpose and meaning in our lives. The artistic endeavour helps us write and share our stories with one another, fostering understanding and community spirit. Investment in the arts is an investment in the future. I look forward to working with the government in discussing future plans for the creative sector in my electorate and exploring how we can further collaborate to ensure the sustainability of arts projects in Fowler.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a privilege to rise and talk about small business today. Small businesses play a key part in my community, as they do in the communities of many members across the parliament. They are more than just businesses; they are, in many cases, part of the fabric of the community. I'm going to talk a little bit about how we need to continue to support them and about the challenges they face. As part of that, I want to share the story of a great member of my community who we unfortunately lost last Monday. His name was Sam. Many knew him as 'Amigo' because that's how he greeted the people at his business. The business was officially called the Red Robin Milk Bar, but many people in our community, including my children, simply knew it as the lolly shop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not a day would go by, when picking my kids up from school, that I wouldn't hear, 'Can we go to the lolly shop today?' Every time we did—mainly on a Friday, if they'd behaved themselves—Amigo would be there. He was called Amigo because he would greet everyone with, 'Hello, Amigo!' He would talk to the kids. He would treat them as very special people, as little adults, and he would always make sure that they got an extra little treat on the way through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was an outpouring of grief through the Mount Evelyn and wider community when Amigo passed away. I was here in Canberra, but I know that when my wife told our children there were tears in our house. There were tears across many houses in our community. It just goes to show that, when we talk about small businesses and family businesses, it's not just the business. They're not just doing it to make a profit. They are providing for their families, but they give so much more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I want to pay tribute to Amigo today. He was a husband to Sue, a father to William and Nina, and a man who gave so much to Mount Evelyn and the Casey community. Rest in peace, Amigo. I hope you're sharing lollies up in heaven with many other people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what it is about. It's the people behind these small businesses, and small businesses across my community and across the country are struggling. Over 2,863 businesses in Victoria have declared insolvency since the Albanese Labor government came to power. Across the country, over 10,000 businesses have declared insolvency. That's the highest number since 2011-12. Small businesses are in crisis; they are struggling. Small business is always the business that gets hit first, the reason being that they don't have cash reserves. They don't have the cash reserves of multinationals or the assets on their books to enable them to get loans and extensions from the banks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when small businesses have their costs and expenses going up and their sales going down, what do we hear from the Minister for Small Business? Nothing. There's silence on support for small business. In almost 2½ years of the Albanese Labor government, the small-business minister has introduced one bill, two months ago, into parliament that was directly related to small business. That's it: 2½ years and one bill. The best initiative we can get from the minister is that, if you invest money that you don't have, you'll get a rebate on a solar panel or a battery. Well, that's nice if you've got the money, but, again, it's just pushing the government's agenda, not actually supporting small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are people who have put it all on the line. They've taken out loans against their house. When my old boss, Andrew Blain, bought Yarra Valley Snack Foods, for about six to 12 months he and his wife had to feed their family on baked beans and two-minute noodles, because they paid their employees first. That's all these small businesses in my community—</span>

I spent over a decade working in the FMCG industry, and I saw firsthand the predatory behaviour of Woolworths and Coles and how they punish small businesses and food manufacturers. I was in the room on those conversations. I will support small business, and Woolworths and Coles do need to be brought to account, but the government also has to do more to create the conditions for small business to survive. Small businesses don't want a handout; they just want the ability to go about their business in a strong economic environment. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:20</span>):  Small businesses and their workers are the backbone of my region. On the New South Wales South Coast we have lots of different businesses—tradies, retailers, providers of hospitality, accommodation and tourism, manufacturers, dairy farmers, health providers and more. It's no wonder that small businesses love the South Coast region. It has so much to offer, including a beautiful environment, beaches, bays, bush and gorgeous villages. It's a great place to raise a family or retire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our local businesses on the New South Wales South Coast have been through a lot, from the drought to the Black Summer bushfires, natural disaster after natural disaster, COVID-19 and more natural disasters, but one thing that our local businesses and communities have in spades is a love for community, supporting each other through some of the toughest of times. That's why we have to do everything possible to support our small businesses. We know they are doing it tough, and workers are too. That is why the Albanese government is doing everything possible to provide relief for small businesses where we can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We provided the $325 energy bill relief for one million small businesses, which businesses in my electorate are starting to benefit from. We provided tax cuts for every taxpayer, which is so important. We know that, when taxpayers have more money in their pay packet, more money is spent in our local businesses, which supports local spending and jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Energy Efficiency Grants for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises program is proving very popular and providing much-needed relief in Gilmour. Just recently I announced the 15 local businesses in Gilmour that were successful in receiving an energy efficiency grant. Grants were around $25,000 and were used by businesses to implement new technology to lower energy consumption and energy costs. I was really pleased to deliver a total of $325,000 in grants for these 15 local businesses, which ranged from caravan parks to hospitality providers, manufacturers, a brewery and more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week I visited one of the successful recipients, a boutique brewery, Dangerous Ales, at Milton. This award-winning brewery has been operating for five years at the Milton Hotel. I was pleased to learn that the grant will help the owners, Damian and Alice, set up new digital tank monitoring technology, which will reduce their energy costs by monitoring their glycol brewing system remotely, using an app. The brewery produces around 200,000 litres of beer per year and supplies artisan beers to local restaurants as well as some major liquor chains and boutique eateries as far away as Tasmania and Western Australia. They produce four or five core beers, including their most popular, Crispy Boi Lager, and release new brews every second or third week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These grants are part of the Albanese's government's commitment to ease cost-of-living pressures for Australian businesses by putting downward pressure on energy bills without adding to inflation. They are just one of many measures outlined in our small business statement, which outlines $641.4 million in targeted support for small businesses in the recent budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take these last moments to give a shout-out to all our amazing local businesses and their workers across Gilmour. Recently I had the pleasure of attending the Eurobodalla Business Awards, hosted by Eurobodalla Shire Council. I have to say this was a wonderful celebration of businesses in the Eurobodalla. On Friday night I attended the Shoalhaven Business Awards, with so many magnificent finalists and award winners. A special shout-out goes to all our Kiama business, ably represented in the Illawarra Business Awards, and well done to the Kiama and District Business Chamber, who always run very progressive and wonderful networking opportunities for local businesses. Thank you to all our small businesses for everything you do to support our workers and communities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="291387" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  I thank the member for Casey for raising this very important issue about the record number of insolvencies we're experiencing under the Albanese government, and I commend him on the compassion he showed in his speech. I remember 'the recession we had to have'. The member for Kennedy might have been in the state parliament when that happened, in the early nineties. It was a very difficult time. I remember it because that's when I learned what the word 'insolvency' meant, as I watched my father's small business go through it. The member for Casey did a great job with this. When we talk about insolvency, we're not talking about something that happens to some corporate entity, or some impersonal thing that takes place on sheets of paper. We are talking, particularly for small businesses, about families who suffer the brunt and don't have the cash savings to ride through these sorts of times. When they get hit, they get hit hard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For us, the car went, the house went and we moved to a different city. For me, that meant a different school, different friends and different football teams. For my dad, it was probably, if we're honest, a big hit to his mental health. He moved from running a business to working as a labourer. For my mum, it meant having to move to Sydney to work. It had a tremendous impact on our family. We went from being a family that was watching my dad go off proudly to run his business, to suffering a huge hit. I certainly wasn't alone. During that time, there were thousands of families across Australia who suffered that. That's what insolvency means. Today we're in a GDP per capita recession. We've been in that situation for five quarters now, and, sadly, what we're seeing is, once again, a lot of kids learning what insolvency means.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right across Australia and right across our economy, a record number of insolvencies are taking place, and it gives me no joy whatsoever to see Queensland leading that table. As we're talking on this topic, what we're talking about is another generation of young Australians looking at the impact it has on their families as these small family businesses go through these terrible times. There is no doubt that those small and medium businesses, those family run businesses, are looking around at the moment and asking themselves: 'Are we better off under Labor? Are we better off since Labor came to government?' Sadly, across the board, the answer is, 'No, we're not better off'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think about the IGA in Southtown in my electorate. They've experienced skyrocketing power bills. They've seen their bills go absolutely through the roof, to the point where John at Southtown is now paying twice what he was previously, despite having installed somewhere around $35,000 worth of energy-saving devices. We've got higher loan repayments as interest continues to push up and up. We've got increased staff costs, adding complexity around hiring. As they look ahead at the IR changes that are coming through as legislation, small businesses have absolutely no idea what they mean, because these are mum-and-dad operations that do not have a legal team who can sit there and trawl through 300 pages of legislation and understand what the impacts are going to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are fewer apprentices and trainees coming through. Since Labor took office, Australia has 85,000 fewer apprentices and trainees—a loss of one in five. That's across the board, and, sadly, we have near-impossible insurance premiums. Insurance rates are going through the roof. So, when these small and medium businesses look out and ask that question, 'Are we better off under Labor?' the answer they're coming back with time and time again is no. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's important to point out is that we are not here by accident. We are not in this situation by accident, but rather by the deliberate design of a series of legislation that Labor has brought about that has made things worse for small businesses in our country. I could point to the price caps in the gas industry, which have done what price caps have done since they were first reported in 300 AD, by the way: they lead to lower supply and higher prices. They do this every time. This happens across the board every time, and it's happening again in our sector. I could talk to the IR legislation that has been brought forward that will make things harder for small businesses. I could talk about the $315 billion of additional spending which is driving inflation. Then we turn to our Minister for Small Business, who has produced a grand total of one piece of legislation relevant to small business. We are here by design. We're in a worse place. This is where Labor has taken us, and this is why small businesses are very upset.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299964" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FERNANDO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  Small businesses represent opportunity for people to take control of their work lives, create jobs and provide for their families. For multicultural communities like mine, starting of small business is more than just a way to make a living. It is a pathway for new migrants to build generational wealth, to establish roots and contribute to the broader Australian economy. Our government is aware that small businesses are facing significant pressures at the moment. As the member for Holt, I'm regularly in contact with small-business owners across my electorate in suburbs such as Hampton Park, Narre Warren South, Lynbrook, Lyndhurst, Cranbourne, Clyde, Botanic Ridge, Pearcedale and Tooradin. Their stories are proof of resilience and a reminder of the challenges they face. The owners of Spin a Yarn, a cafe and a yarn store run by two mothers next to my office in Cranbourne West, have spoken honestly with me about the difficulties they are currently facing with escalating electricity costs and the reduction in sales as people struggle with the cost of living. Pressure like this has made many small-business owners consider selling. That's a heartbreaking prospect for any family that has poured their heart and soul into their livelihood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for small businesses like Spin a Yarn that this year's budget includes more than $640 million dollars in practical and targeted support. This support includes measures such as a $325 energy bill rebate and the extension of the instant asset write-off. These initiative are designed to ease the burden on small businesses, helping them to stay afloat and continue contributing to our communities. Small-business owners are also set to benefit under Labor's stage 3 tax cuts. With the average small-business owner in Australia earning approximately $76,000 a year, they are set to save an extra $1,600 per year than they would have under the coalition. These are practical steps the Albanese Labor government is taking to support small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me address the claims made by the opposition. They've attempted to paint a picture of unprecedented business bankruptcies under this government, but this is simply misleading. What we are witnessing today with business bankruptcy is a delayed consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Government policies during the pandemic kept insolvency rates historically low, as businesses were shielded from the full effect of the economic downturn. The Reserve Bank governor, who the opposition is fond of quoting, recently stated, 'If you look at the trend of insolvencies over time, we are not even back to where we were trend-wise pre-pandemic.' Let's be clear: no business going under in this country is good. Every closure represents a family, a dream and a loss for our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the opposition's attempt to twist the facts for political gain is not only unhelpful; it is also disingenuous. They are more interested in scoring political points than in genuinely supporting small businesses. This is the same opposition that ignores expert advice when it suits them, whether it's the advice of Reserve Bank governor or scientists at the CSIRO or the security concerns raised by the Director-General of Security at ASIO. The Albanese Labor government remains committed to backing Australia's 2.5 million small businesses. We understand the challenges they face, and we will continue to provide the support they need to thrive in these difficult times.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PRICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:34</span>):  I rise to speak in support of a motion by the member for Casey, which correctly points out that Australia's small business sector is at breaking point. They're at breaking point because of the economic incompetence of those opposite and because of their cost-of-living crisis. Small businesses are not immune to higher rents, higher energy bills, higher prices for goods and, of course, the dozen interest rate rises that have occurred under this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this cost-of-living pain has led to another record being set by the Albanese Labor government and, once again, it's not a record to be proud of. Data released by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission show the number of businesses that entered into insolvency last financial year was 11,049. That is the highest number ever recorded. By contrast, the number of insolvencies in 2020-21, when we were in government and we were combatting a once-in-a-century pandemic, was 4,235. In my home state of Western Australia, 733 businesses entered into insolvency last financial year. Not surprisingly, businesses linked to the construction sector accounted for the most insolvencies, which, of course, only exacerbates our housing crisis. This was followed by insolvencies in the accommodation and hospitality sectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like this will be a record for long. Gayle Dickerson, who sits on the Turnaround Management Association board has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We're not at the peak yet. The consensus and my view is we've probably got another 12 months really kind of still ramping up before we hit the peak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is reinforced by results from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry's WA business confidence survey, conducted earlier this year. That survey found that 18 per cent of businesses believed they were at risk of closing or were significantly scaling back their operations this year. Think of it: that's almost one in five businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when businesses are hurting more than ever before, you would think those opposite would do something in their power to put downward pressure on inflation and provide support to the sector. Unfortunately, they are not. In fact, under those opposite, as we know has been well reported, inflation is heading in the wrong direction, with Australia an outlier amongst advanced economies. Instead of providing support to businesses, Labor has chosen to make it harder by adding further costs, confusion and complexity to the industrial relations system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently wrote to the small businesses across my Durack community about these reforms. I also sought their feedback on what issues they would like to see us address in this place. The top five issues raised with me were (1) cutting and simplifying red tape, (2) rising insurance premiums, which are a big deal in WA, particularly across the north, (3) lower, simpler and fairer taxes, (4) difficulty finding skilled staff and affording wages costs, and (5) ensuring affordable and reliable energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's consider whether Labor are addressing these concerns. In regard to red tape, the industrial relations reforms of those opposite have only made an already far-too-complex system even harder to navigate. One of the biggest issues for small business is that casual employment has been redefined. Before these changes, a casual employee was defined solely by reference to the terms of the employment contract. The new definition consist of 15 factors that consider the real substance, practical reality and true nature of the employment relationship. These changes would effectively stop casuals working regular patterns of work. We know this will disproportionally impact small businesses, as they employ 80 per cent of Australia's casual workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about taxes? The coalition has proposed extending the instant asset write-off to $30,000 and making this an ongoing for businesses. Labor voted against this proposal, leaving the scheme at $20,000 and due to expire. I also note when we were in government we reduced the small business tax rate from 30 per cent to 25 per cent. This meant that the tax rate was at its lowest level in 50 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are no good on red tape and no good on taxes. What about ensuring affordable and reliable energy? I don't think I really need to say much more about that. Labor, you need to do better.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  Seriously, this is a cheap and lazy motion by the member for Casey. He casts around for an easy statistic, rips it out of context and then tries to blame something on the current government. We heard the member for Durack rip on just now about insurance premiums as though climate change hadn't had something to do with the fact that there has been an increased need for payouts. And affordable energy? Seriously, is a $600 billion debt to every single Australian somehow going to make any small business's energy bills cheaper? Cutting regulations? I don't think last week was the first time you heard about small businesses needing help with regulations, because the reality is that that has been an ongoing issue for every government, but it's something we're actually prepared to tackle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as it isn't possible to create a good economic environment overnight, it isn't possible to create a bad one in a short time either. It takes years of neglect to create a really bad system. The member for Casey and the member for Durack can learn how to do that in their party room if they're around long enough. The coalition had a poor grants system, a poor robodebt system, a poor submarine procurement system and no system at all for working out what portfolios their Prime Minister had. They are the specialists at setting up a poor system and sitting back and watching it all fall completely to bits over time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Casey knows that the pandemic had a deleterious effect on many businesses and also that many were propped up during it. Unfortunately, $30 billion of our taxpayers' dollars went to businesses making a profit, because the coalition just could not care to set up a system to ensure the money went to those small businesses that needed it the most. We know that banks and other lenders also gave a lot of help to all sorts and sizes of businesses. Since the pandemic, we've had a supply crisis, a rise in energy costs and a rise in inflation. These conditions are worldwide and we are working to tackle them head-on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Casey will be aware of the comments on this matter by the Reserve Bank governor last Friday at the public hearing of the House Standing Committee on Economics, of which I am a member so I heard the comments firsthand. She outlined how, during the pandemic, there was a lot of government support for business and there were very low interest rates. At that time, the level of business insolvencies was at a historic low as a result. The number has gone up since. Governor Bullock was at pains to point out, however, that, given the increasing number of businesses, the figure was not at a historic high and indeed that the number of insolvencies was not yet back at the pre-pandemic trend levels. But that doesn't mean we don't care, because what the governor went on to say was that there was a bit missing from the debate about this and a little bit of understanding was needed. The member for Casey knows this. He knows he is cherrypicking statistics, and he is happy to cherrypick at the expense of small business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is on small business, so let's talk about a few of the great things that we have in fact done already in our two short years. The Minister for Small Business announced on 24 July more than $41 million to help more than 1,700 small businesses upgrade their facilities to take control of their energy bills and lower emissions through round 2 of the Energy Efficiency Grants for Small and Medium Enterprises. On 23 July we took action on the payment times for small business. Members opposite might have done that, but of course they didn't. The Payment Times Reporting Amendment Act passed last sitting. This legislation will ensure that big business is held accountable for poor payment practices. Better payment times reduce administration and financing costs. It's certainly the sort of thing that would actually help small businesses stay afloat and make ends meet each month. But it was clearly not enough for the Liberal and National parties to take action on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are encouraging small businesses to go green and save money at the same time. On 5 July the Minister for Small Business announced that farmers, freight companies and other small and medium businesses would be able to get cheaper finance for rooftop solar, batteries and more energy-efficient vehicles and equipment—a far cry from the $600 billion promise of nuclear energy that the Leader of the Opposition is promising instead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is more: energy bill relief of $325 to around one million small businesses; extending the $20,000 instant asset write-off, contrary to the member for Durack's misleading comments earlier; abolishing 457 nuisance tariffs to cut compliance costs and reduce red tape, contrary to the member for Durack's statements earlier; and a new, higher target to source 20 per cent of Commonwealth procurement below $1 billion, and 40 per cent of procurement below $20 million, from small and medium enterprises.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  I'm happy to rise to speak to this motion by the member for Casey. For those listening at home, it in effect says that Australian small businesses are at breaking point and have been failed by this government. It points out that, in my state of New South Wales alone, 4,635 businesses have closed over the last 12 months, and that this government, the Labor-Green-teal government, is now the worst government on record for Australian businesses, having surpassed the 10,757 businesses collapsing under the government of 2011-12.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gives me no joy to speak about this, having been in business myself for 16 years and knowing how tough business is. I remember going through the GFC in 2008 and 2009, paying my employees, paying rent which was nothing like rents these days, paying electricity bills which were nothing like electricity bills these days and going home and saying to my wife—and this is a true story—'We don't have any money this fortnight; this is really tough.' I look back on those days, and they are nothing like now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Saturday I went into a local coffee shop, which people in the metropolitan areas would call a hole in the wall. It's got a fridge. It's got a coffee machine. It's got lights. I spoke to the owner. I said, 'How are things going?' and she said, 'My electricity bill went from $4,000 a quarter to $6,000 a quarter,' for a hole in the wall in Maxwell. She's got employees—and she's saying the same thing about the butcher around the corner. But I guess she's lucky. She's getting through and still coping because she has a very strong, established business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other businesses out there, like Wicked Elf Beer in Port Macquarie, who'd been around for a decade. They closed their doors as a direct result of this government's rush to renewables and energy policy. After 10 years they shut the door because their electricity bill was higher than their rental bill. This was a brewery eight times—10 times—the size of this room, and they had to shut down. People lost their jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we come into this room and talk about what the government is doing, there's actually human emotion at stake. These people have families and children that go to schools in the local areas. Then the government implements industrial relations laws that allow union representatives to come into your workplace and tie you up in knots on a suspicion—not a reasonable suspicion, just a suspicion—that you might not be doing the right thing. Even through 12 years in the police, I had to have a reasonable suspicion to stop somebody or talk to somebody. They can walk in and tie business owners up in knots. Those people—those mums and dads or generational businesses—don't have the money for lawyers, so they have to spend hundreds of hours wasting time rather than getting on with business. There is no doubt that the reason we are seeing these statistics of closures in record numbers—you've seen in the construction industry alone a 111 per cent increase in the closure of construction companies—is a direct result of the poor policies of Labor, the Greens and the teals, who don't understand business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer himself—and I do not believe that he had the gall to say this—said he lasted six long, long months in private industry. What an insult to private industry and small business, who are the backbone of our economies, particularly in regional and rural areas. The Treasurer should hang his head in shame, and the government should hang their head in shame for what they've done to small business.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  I recognise that right now small businesses are under a lot of pressure, and I think that it's a challenging time that we're having within the Australian economy. I recognise that some of the top issues that small businesses are dealing with include skills shortages, cybersecurity, digital transformation, the regulatory environment and inflationary pressures. I'd say that each of these areas is an area the Albanese Labor government is working on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm in touch with our community and I meet with small businesses regularly in my electorate. Recently I got to meet Simon from Stuart &amp; Heaton Clothing. They started in Belmont, in the heart of Swan, and they provide a range of workwear to a range of industries, including firefighters and policemen. I think that it's great that they started in the heart of Swan and now they operate all across the nation. It's great to hear stories of innovation, hard work and resilience. It's also great to hear of workers being treated fairly and recognised for their hard work. In this particular organisation, one of the codes that they've signed up to is ethical clothing, and so they've got good standards for their procurement chain and making sure that workers are indeed being paid fairly, and what that means is that firefighters and police officers have confidence in the clothes that are being made right here in Australia. But, in saying that, I know it's not all roses, and I understand that the challenges of running a small business are real.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the Albanese government is focused on providing practical support and long-term solutions to help small businesses thrive. Our policies are designed with one goal in mind: to strengthen the resilience of small businesses while offering targeted assistance to those encountering difficulties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I think about who the largest employer is across Australia, it is indeed small to medium businesses. So, in preparing for this debate tonight, I did some research about what has happened to small businesses in my electorate. What I found might surprise the member for Casey. According to .id, Australia's provider of demographic statistics to local government, there are 4,205 businesses in the town of Victoria Park, compared to 3,933 in 2021. That's an increase of 272 businesses in the town of Vic Park since we have been in power. In the City of Belmont in 2023, there were 4,529 businesses, compared to 4,225 in 2021. Again, to do the maths, that's an increase of 304 businesses in the City of Belmont since we came to power. In the City of Canning in 2023, there were 10,711 small businesses, compared to 9,995 in 2021. That's a substantial increase of 716 businesses in the City of Canning. So, in just those three local government areas in my electorate, that's a total of 1,292 new businesses. It's pretty impressive. To put it another way, there were 19,445 businesses in total in 2023, compared to 18,153 businesses in 2021. That's a seven per cent increase in the number of businesses since the Liberals were in power. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An increase in businesses means an increase in local jobs as well, and we have seen an increase in jobs in the south-west region, where my electorate sits, since the Liberals were in power. Recent labour force figures reveal an unemployment rate of 3.7 per cent in the region in May 2024, compared to 5.1 per cent in 2021.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those figures are positive news to my thriving community. Of course, I acknowledge that we need to ensure that we provide an environment that supports businesses to prosper. This year, the budget allocated over $640 million in support specifically tailored to small businesses. Whether it's for navigating financial stress or accessing expert advice, there is advice. For businesses facing tough times, there's the Small Business Debt Helpline. It's free and government supported. We continue to employ different actions to help small businesses every day.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's often been said that small business is the engine room of the economy. That's true. We could have a discussion about why that is. Why are small businesses the engine room of the economy? There are so many of them, of course. They're traditionally very high in productivity. This is due to several factors, including the fact that a small business is flexible and able to adapt to market change. Also—this is probably the key thing—the financial stakeholders of a small business are often the managers. They are often families. The level of personal risk that these small-business people put themselves under leads to extremely hard work, innovation and very high productivity. I have many small businesses in my electorate: farms, shops, small manufacturers and service businesses. A lot of them involve agriculture and food manufacturing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tragedy in Australia at the moment is that small business insolvencies are up, and that's not good for Australia. Let's have a think about why small-business insolvencies are up. I'm sure all of us are talking to our small-business communities. They are telling us that they're finding business very hard at the moment. We've got an inflationary environment, and that's making things tough. Input costs are up. One of the causes of this is government spending, and there's lower overall productivity in the economy. There's an expanded public sector taking key workers away from private enterprise. Input costs are up, especially energy. Gas and electricity are more expensive. Insurance is more expensive. In many cases, the infrastructure is not keeping up. The road network is not doing what it needs to do to make sure small business, particularly in my area, can get its produce to where it needs to go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that is really frustrating the small businesses that I talk to is the industrial relations changes. The small businesses I talk to are really worried about the regulatory burden that this is going to put upon them. It's easier for a corporation to deal with that. They've got a huge HR department, and they can try and work through the morass of extra legislation that exists as a result of the new government. Put yourself in the shoes of a small business that's got to try and work through all of that. It's really hard. They can't afford to hire big costly HR departments, so they've often got to be up really late doing that themselves. Also, flexibility is reduced with these new IR laws, particularly in relation to casual employees. That really hurts small businesses, who need that flexibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing small business tells me is that, increasingly, everyone seems to want to clip the ticket of what they do. For a hardworking small business—let's say they're an apple grower, a dairy farmer or a food manufacturer—dealing with the number of government bureaucracies that want to come in and add a cost to their business and have cost recovery just makes it harder and harder. These people feel that their work is not being respected. They feel, 'The government is just feeding off my hard work, my risk and my effort by sending a bunch of bureaucrats in there to make sure I'm compliant with this and that, and to make sure I've followed this regulation.' We're not going to get more small businesses by doing that. A fruit grower that I spoke to earlier today said to me, 'Sam, it seems like it's death by a thousand cuts.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're so risk averse, as a society, We're also worried about what the government's going to do to us, even if we make an innocent mistake. We spend so much on self-regulation now that it's tying us up in knots. It kills productivity. Productivity lifts profitability, and that lifts everyone's living standards. The policies we have seen from this government are not supporting that aim.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144732" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:59</span>):  Small businesses are facing a lot of pressure right now. I know that from talking to the small businesses in my community. The Albanese Labor government is committed to helping small businesses build resilience in the long term and to providing practical support for small businesses that are experiencing challenges. This year's budget provides more than $640 million in practical, targeted support for small businesses. For small businesses that need assistance, there is a free, government-supported phone line, the Small Business Debt Helpline, with experienced small business financial counsellors who can provide advice to weather a difficult time. This helps to support the mental health of small business owners who face unique challenges, as their mental state is connected to the financial health of their businesses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other ways our government is supporting the financial health of small businesses is through the NewAccess for Small Business Owners program, which provides tailored, free and confidential mental health support to small business owners. Small businesses can also engage early with the Australian Taxation Office, which can provide support to people finding themselves in difficulty. Our government is also funding the expansion of the National Tax Clinic program, with an additional five clinics across the country providing small businesses and individuals with better tax advice and help. Small businesses can also access the Tax Concierge Service through the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. This ombudsman is funded to provide support where there may be disputes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are easing the pressure on small businesses by streamlining processes to minimise administrative burdens and to help them bounce back from challenges. In particular, eligible small businesses will receive the $325 energy bill relief payment under our most recent budget. Our government also provided $1.8 million to progress regulatory reforms to retail energy markets that will ensure small businesses are on electricity contracts that work better for them. I was really pleased to visit a small business in my electorate, the Scott Leggo Gallery, with the Minister for Small Business to talk about those announcements from our budget and hear how it would benefit them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are levelling the playing field for small businesses by enabling healthy competition and ensuring small businesses get a fair go. We are supporting small businesses to grow by removing barriers to entry and we're encouraging growth in the small business sector by reviewing and reforming Australia's competition policy settings to increase productivity, reduce the cost of living and boost wages. Australian small businesses are obviously vital to the country's prosperity. We are doing everything we can to ensure that small businesses continue to play their critical role in making Australia's economy stronger. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Casey's assertions that we are failing small businesses are utterly false. We are doing more than ever to support small businesses and ensure that they continue to thrive in the future. We know that, with the unwinding of COVID-era relief, the number of corporate insolvencies is slightly exceeding previous peaks. However, the level of corporate insolvencies as a proportion of all companies is lower than the long-term historical average. Companies entering external administration are also increasingly using the small business restructuring process to successfully restructure their debt and remain in business. This is something I've heard a lot about from people in my electorate. The government will continue to monitor developments in this space. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know small businesses are the engine room of our nation's economy. They collectively employ more than five million Australians and contribute more than $500 billion to our nation's economy every year. We are continuing to back Australia's 2.5 million small businesses to ensure that they have confidence and certainty going forward. We are lucky that, in the member for Franklin, we have a minister for small business who is passionate about and committed to helping small businesses thrive. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By backing Australian small business, we are backing Australia's future economic growth. We are supporting local communities to whom small businesses provide jobs, revenue and services, strengthening these communities. By building small business resilience we build the resilience of the nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I moved this motion because I believe in a future made in Australia—a future that is built on a pathway to net zero emissions, and that pathway runs right through our national resources sector. We are a lucky country, blessed with amazing solar and wind resources above the ground and blessed with critical minerals and rare earths below the ground. These are the things that we need to transition to clean energy. And where are these resources? They're right under our feet, and it only makes sense for Labor to invest in these minerals' future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a $17 billion production tax incentive, which is the cornerstone of that plan. It's not about funding; it's about building a future made here in Australia. This incentive is designed to create jobs, support local and regional communities and drive the future of our economy. Let's be clear: there are no handouts here. Companies will only receive a tax credit if they process critical minerals onshore, because we can make them here, and under Labor's strategic vision we will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's the problem with making more things here in Australia? I don't see one. What's stopping us? The opposition has mixed messages and a lack of clarity. You might recall the Leader of the Opposition's take on Labor's critical minerals investment program. It's hard to keep on track because he says one thing on the east coast, dismissing it as tax cuts for billionaires, and another thing in WA, when he falls back to his usual line: 'Well, we'll have more to say about that.' But when will he be clear with Australians?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just a few weeks ago he was attacking Labor's vision of building a future made in Australia. Even his deputy joined in, saying that they would oppose the plan. What's the real stance? Are they wanting to support a vital industry for WA, or are they sticking to the same tired script of negativity? The truth is that the coalition has turned its back on the resources sector. The shadow Treasurer opposes the tax incentive. Why? It makes no sense to not foster a future in critical minerals, especially one that keeps processing onshore, creates jobs, supports local families and supports regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On nuclear, they're also all over the place. When will the opposition leader come clean on how much this plan will actually cost? This is the standard that they're living up to—confusion, flip-flopping—depending where they are and the time of day, and depending which side of the country they're on and who their audience is. They're not really interested in Western Australia. They only say what they think people on the west coast want to hear. They're not genuine. They don't get it. The Liberals are known for inaction and turning their backs. Let's not forget that, when they were in power, the approvals ground to a halt because they cut the environment department's resources by 40 per cent. We've doubled that since taking office, because we're not sitting on our hands. We have a plan and we're implementing it. We're engaged with the resources sector, because we understand it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I understand it, having worked in the industry for more than 15 years. I've seen firsthand what happens when we plan to invest. I witnessed that in Kambalda, a nickel-mining town. That's why I'm in a unique position to appreciate how crucial it is to support onshore processing of critical minerals. By doing so, we can seize the opportunity and create good jobs—local jobs, jobs for the future, jobs for families, jobs that build a community. We're not turning our backs on the resources sector or on the people who depend on it for their livelihoods. We're standing with them, investing in their future, because their future is our future, and ensuring that Australia is prosperous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I moved this motion because I want to encourage all the members of the House to support it. Those not doing so would be turning their backs on the resources sector. We can't afford to do that. Let's build that future right here in Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  I appreciate the opportunity to talk about the government and their tax treatment of the resources sector. They've certainly had a change of heart since the Rudd era, when they taxed the mining industry into oblivion. We'll never forget the attacks on the sector that the Rudd government undertook when they sought to bring in their mining tax and sap all confidence out of sector and from the companies that were making investment decisions and competing against other economies around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, in mining and resources, like anything in economics, there's always a finite resource for infinite demand. There are a lot of places in the world that are pitching for investment in the mining and resources sector, and Australia is but one of them. It's vital to our economy. The Labor Party have had a very chequered history when it comes to the way in which they've introduced sovereign risk to that sector. The Rudd government's mining tax is but one of many such risks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sector certainly do not view the government as being friendly towards them. They view them with a great deal of suspicion. The sector are concerned about what their future might be under a Labor government. They're starting to find out more and more that this government is about picking winners and issuing press releases saying that they support particular things. However, the actions of the government and performance of the government tends to lead to a dramatically different outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the Liberal Party is the party of low tax. We want taxes to be as low as they can be. We want them to be as fair as they can be as well. We think that everyone should pay their fair share of tax, and you'd hope that that wasn't a point in dispute. We are also not the party of picking winners and suggesting that the government should be intervening in the free, proper operation of a market, because we'd like to see investments being decided on the basis of their merit. We'd also like Australia to be a safe and reliable investment destination. Those are the principles that we bring to policy decisions in this country, particularly industry policy decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mining and resources sector, of which the critical minerals sector is a part, know full well that they can rely on coalition governments to have steady, reliable, sensible policies that are about supporting businesses, giving them confidence to invest in our economy and giving them confidence that the policy settings that are in place when they make investment decisions will endure and will stay in place as time goes forward. The investment profile and horizon of this sector, like that of many, is measured in at least decades. When you reflect on the very chequered approach and attitudes of this Labor government and, in particular, members of this government, that consistency is not there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I hope that the Labor Party will not be in government for much longer, even worse than that would be the bigger threat of a future Labor government that is not in government alone but is instead in government in coalition with another party—the Greens. If you're in the mining and minerals resources sector, the most frightening concept for your business and for the tens of thousands of Australians that work directly in those businesses, as well as the hundreds of thousands of Australians that work indirectly in that sector, is a Labor-Greens government. That would mean the end of that sector entirely. That's what the price of the Greens would be in doing a deal to form minority government if the unhappy situation plays out as the polls are currently indicating. That is on the cards. The mining and resources sector could have no more nightmarish a scenario than that of a Labor-Greens government where the Greens hold that minority Labor government hostage on policies around mining. We already know what the attitudes of the Greens are on that topic, and we also know that they will insist on commitments that involve the ending of so many of those vitally important businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion talks about the critical minerals sector and mining and resources. We, in the coalition, have a completely unimpeachable history of backing that sector, of supporting that sector, of giving that sector policy certainty and of never introducing sovereign risk to that sector. We're the only political force in this country that can say that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  As members of the government know all too well, the road to net zero emissions is paved with Australia's rich resources. Beneath our vast land lies a treasure trove of critical minerals—minerals the world desperately needs to power the renewable energy technologies of tomorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is blessed to be one of the word's largest exporters of lithium and the third-largest producer of cobalt. These minerals, along with others like nickel and rare earth elements, are the backbone of the global transition to renewable energy. However, our role in this transition cannot and should not be limited to merely extracting these resources and shipping them overseas. We simply must do more than just dig up stuff and put it on a boat; we've been doing that for way too long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, we want to do more onshore because it'll grow our economy and create jobs here at home. That's precisely what the Albanese government's $17 billion critical minerals production tax incentive is designed to achieve. This incentive is a game changer for industry and for onshore processing of critical minerals. It's a forward-thinking initiative that will drive investment into our critical minerals sector. It'll create secure, well-paying jobs that will support local communities and build industries critical for the future of the global economy. Our policies are about ensuring Australia becomes not just a supplier of raw materials but a leader in the global supply chain for renewable energy technologies. Our production tax credits are a targeted smart use of our tax system to solve big problems, leverage our competitive advantage and enhance Australia's prosperity. If companies don't process these critical minerals onshore, they don't receive a tax credit; it's as simple as that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This low-risk approach will grow our critical minerals industry and create jobs for future generations. But, as usual, the Liberals and Nationals seem unable to decide whether or not they support Australian jobs, Australian manufacturing and the Australian critical minerals sector. The Leader of the Opposition has been flying back and forth across the country, saying one thing in Western Australia and another on the east coast. His best mate, the shadow Treasurer, has made his opposition to this policy clear, effectively turning his back on the critical minerals sector that is so crucial to our nation's decarbonised future. They claim to support the resources sector in one breath only to undermine it in the next. This duality shows just how out of touch they are with the realities of the industry and the needs of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, our government has been consistent in its support for the critical minerals sector. Whether on the west coast, the east coast or anywhere else, our message is the same: we will back Australia's critical minerals industry to thrive, create jobs and help decarbonise the world, because the global demand for critical minerals is surging. The world needs lithium, our cobalt and nickel and other minerals to produce batteries, wind turbines and solar panels that are essential for the global transition to clean energy. This presents a golden opportunity for Australia to cement its place in the world as a renewable energy superpower.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our free trading partners, like the United States, Japan, Korea, India and the UK—even the EU—are all racing to diversify their sources of critical minerals. They are seeking reliable partners who can ensure the resilience of global supply chains. Unlike the Liberals and Nationals, Labor is stepping up to meet this challenge. We're strengthening our strategic partnerships with our allies through the Australia-United States Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Transformation Compact, which includes a ministerial level taskforce to drive collaboration in this space. Our government won't sit by and ignore this vital part of our resources sector, as those opposite did for a decade; we will unashamedly support critical minerals processing onshore so that our nation can capitalise on this golden opportunity to create good, well-paid jobs here in Australia and ensure that Australia remains at the forefront of the global transition to renewable energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are at such an important juncture here. We can go down the path of the opposition and not support our critical minerals sector and not support local manufacturing, and, along with it, miss out on all the opportunities that will present themselves, or we can invest in a future made in Australia. We can invest in the jobs of the future and we can help the world decarbonise.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that we are now living in a world which has not seen this sort of geopolitical instability since the end of the Second World War. I don't think there is too much doubt about that from anybody. The late, great Senator Jim Molan said this:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to the late, great Jim Molan, who worked so assiduously in his public life as a parliamentarian and long before it. I specifically note the work he did to bring national attention to the need for a national security strategy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the threat assessments of Director-General of Security of ASIO Mike Burgess in February this year and last year that foreign interference and espionage have become the No. 1 threat in this country, more so than even terrorism. Foreign interference, foreign interference and espionage are being done on our shores and from offshore, attacking us as we speak. Our critical infrastructure as a nation and the vital businesses that provide that to Australians are under constant attack from governments, such as the Chinese Communist Party, Russia, North Korea and Iran, at unprecedented rates. These countries and others are constantly testing our capability to defend the critical infrastructure that we have in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Jim has talked about in the past, there's no point having a wonderful defence strategy if you don't have an overarching national security strategy. A national defence strategy is just one element of a national security strategy. In this day and age, when we are being attacked particularly from a cyber perspective, we need to have that overall, encompassing, whole-of-society approach. We need to ensure that our ADF is at its best to be able to defend this nation, and we need to be able to defend all of our critical infrastructure and private industry that provides defence manufacturing. These things are critical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, we know that this government is asleep at the wheel in relation to defence. They scrapped the $1 billion National Space Mission for Earth Observation. They scrapped it. When I was in the US last year, there were US officials coming up to me and speaking to me off the record, absolutely incredulous as to why this Labor government would scrap the construction of four satellites. The first time Australia would have that sort of capability is now dead. This government has overseen $80 billion in cuts to defence. They are absolutely asleep at the wheel when it comes to border security. There is a lot more to border security than just having Border Force, and this government clearly is asleep at the wheel, as we've seen with the NZYQ case, which involved hundreds of people being released into the community. Of course, we're now seeing people coming from Gaza without appropriate security checks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government needs to get cracking on AUKUS pillar II to increase the technology that comes from that. It needs to ensure that our food, our fuel and our skilled workforce have the sort of security that would only come from an all-encompassing, community-wide national security strategy that involves state and local governments across the country. Only a national government can provide that sort of leadership. Sadly, this lot are asleep at the wheel. I implore the government to look very seriously at this. It's an important project. It's something that Jim Molan pushed for a long time and it's something that I have been pushing for a long time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:25</span>):  I'd like to commence with some remarks on the motion moved by the member for Fisher by joining him in paying tribute, as he did at the end of the motion, to Senator Jim Molan AO, DSC. As members will be aware, Senator Molan had a long and distinguished military career, serving in the Australian Army for more than 40 years and reaching the rank of Major General. He served in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, East Timor, Malaysia, Germany, the United States and Iraq. He was made an Officer of the Order of Australia. Senator Molan was a great Australian, and may he rest in peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in a world where nations seek to increase their access to resources and capital. There's nothing wrong with that; all nations want to increase their resources and their capital, but some of the nations that were mentioned earlier by the member for Fisher are looking to do so doing in an illegal way and through immoral means. We only have to observe recent events in Ukraine to see the devastating impact this can have on a population that has been invaded. Even though there is an embargo on Russia, we know and we can see how they're still getting some of their products out illegally through some of these rogue nations, including Iran and a whole range of others. This is something that's really worrying the EU at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an enormous impact on a population that has been invaded. Even though, in World War II, we were never invaded, we came incredibly close to it in your neck of the words, in the Northern Territory, Deputy Speaker Scrymgour. We know that Darwin was bombed and that there was a real enemy on our shores. We have to do everything we can to stop invasions, like Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other invasions that we've seen around the world. We have to ensure that such illegal and inappropriate things do not happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, this is not a new phenomenon, as I said. Last month I attended a commemorative service in Cyprus for the 50th anniversary of the illegal Turkish invasion in Cyprus. This illegal invasion is still a tremendous source of pain for so many people. Even after 50 years, there are still 40,000 foreign troops on the soil of a sovereign country. Certainly, Turkiye has to work out which side of the fence it's on. I know they're members of NATO, but, at the same time, they're getting extremely close with the nations that the member for Fisher mentioned—Russia, Iran and many other nations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the National Defence Strategy released in April 2024 confirms, we confront the most challenging strategic circumstances since the Second World War, and we do so at a time when Australia's economic connection to the world has never been greater. We need to develop a more integrated and focused Australian Defence Force so we can defend Australia and our immediate region, protect our economic connection to the world and contribute with our partners to regional security and stability. Australia's acquisition of conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarines, through the AUKUS agreement, is fundamental to this. It will ensure we have a defence force with a much greater capacity to deter a potential adversary's attempts to project power against Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is absolutely committed to securing a strong and safe future for all Australians. When we came to government, Australians were more vulnerable to cyberattacks than citizens of any other developed country. Too many Australian citizens and businesses were left out in the cold by the former coalition government, which had fallen asleep at the wheel on cybersecurity. We know this complacency opened the door for attacks that have compromised the data of millions of Australians and left Australia years behind where we should be in cybersecurity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this Albanese Labor government is doing the hard work in cybersecurity that should have started a decade ago. We now have a dedicated Minister for Cyber Security in cabinet and have appointed Australia's first National Cyber Security Coordinator. Working with industry and the community, the Albanese government's 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy sets out how we're making Australia a harder target, how we'll help Australians bounce back from cyberattacks and how we're fighting back against cybercriminals. I know no country can reduce cyberattack risks to zero, but these changes will significantly strengthen Australia's cyber defences. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:30</span>):  I rise to support the motion moved by my friend the member for Fisher regarding the current environment of geopolitical instability that we face and the fundamental failure of this Albanese government to comprehend, grasp and act in necessary ways to keep Australians safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fisher and I both serve on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and National Security and also the Joint Select Committee on Social Media and Australian Society. That is no coincidence because, as we know, social media has become one of the principal vectors for both foreign interference from abroad and radicalisation and extremism within our own borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Exactly a year ago this month, a significant report was released by the Australian Senate under the stewardship of another great coalition contributor to the national security debate, Senator James Paterson, now shadow minister for home affairs. That report provided a comprehensive analysis of the tactics used by foreign interests to disturb the Australian democracy via disinformation campaigns, harassment of our diaspora communities and gathering intelligence on individuals. The report identified a number of responsibilities of the social media platforms which operate in Australia, including measures to increase transparency, to label state affiliated media and posting, and to disclose government directions regarding content.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report suggested a number of possible and responsible government actions, including banning some high-risk apps on government devices, establishing a national security technology office and supporting independent research to counter interference. It also called on civil society to invest in public education, to lift our level of digital literacy and to support diaspora communities to build resilience against foreign interference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report did not pull its punches, stating quite clearly that foreign interference and espionage threaten the things that we value most about our country: our social cohesion, our trusted democracy and our freedoms. It recognised the role of social media as a potential highway for ill-intentioned content, citing social media itself is not the threat, but it is a vector for foreign interference. It was clear about the contemporary risk we all face, warning us that authoritarian regimes like China and Russia are deploying new methods for cyber enabled disinformation activities as part of a broader, integrated strategic campaign to advance their own national interests at Australia's expense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the report recognised the particular vulnerability of our diaspora communities. Many people living in Australia are not free of the long hand of their repressive former governments, which are reaching across the seas to continue to engage in acts of intimidation, harassment and violence, including through social media.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The use of social media as a method of radicalisation and extremism is of equal concern, particularly for our domestic intelligence and national security bodies. As recently as last week the director-general of ASIO, in an ABC interview, indicated that these concerns have in no way diminished in the last year. In discussion with David Speers, Mike Burgess AM said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The trouble with the internet is it's the greatest incubator of violent extremism and social media and the downside is the greatest accelerator of violent extremism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the algorithms companies use to direct content, a youth only has to search something once, and then, in their search feed, they get plenty of violent extremism or extremism material, which is unhelpful and hurtful for their young, forming brains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week my colleagues on the Joint Select Committee on Social Media and Australian Society had the benefit of a briefing from Audrey Tang, the former digital minister of Taiwan, regarding measures that country has taken to fight foreign interference and safeguard democracy. Taiwan has one of the most digitally enabled populations and governments, but that comes with obvious risks, as one of the most targeted for disinformation from foreign governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, former Taiwanese President Tsai described the dual challenge faced by this most determined democracy:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In her comments to the social media committee last week, the former digital minister informed us that, even though Taiwan has the second-highest religious diversity in the world, it now consistently ranks as one of the least polarised countries. Taiwan looks beyond what is said online to where it comes from, data transparency of platforms and the way an algorithm prioritises information. Importantly, Taiwan teaches schoolchildren not only how to consume media but how to contribute to media and online discourse. We have much to learn from the bold approaches of others.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:36</span>):  I thank the member for Fisher for raising this important matter. The member's motion calls for a national security strategy. We last had a national security strategy under the Gillard government, and it went to much of what the member for Fisher seeks, such as objectives to protect and strengthen our sovereignty, to ensure a safe and resilient population, to secure our assets, infrastructure and institutions and to promote a favourable international environment and more. I'm happy to table that because, whilst the member for Fisher is not a new member, he clearly did not know that document existed. I think it's even more ironic that he is calling for a new national security strategy two years into the Albanese government, when the coalition governments of Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison didn't bother. I note also that the member's motion presupposes that the Albanese government will be in office in 2027. I appreciate the member's confidence in that regard, whilst taking nothing for granted, of course, in Hasluck.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going to the specifics of the motion, we can see that these are all in fact subjects of action by this government. In just two years the Albanese government has done more work and achieved more than the coalition government did in nine—and the member does know this. One of the first actions of the Albanese government was to engage the Hon. Stephen Smith and Sir Angus Houston to provide the government with the Defence Strategic Review, arguably the most important overarching document in the defence and security space since the 1986 Dibb report. The Defence Strategic Review will inform government policies across defence preparedness, capability and posture for the decades to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2024 National Defence Strategy is the first of the biennial strategies recommended by the DSR. It is wideranging, covering the strategic environment, strategy, structure, bases, investment, partnerships, industry, personnel and resourcing. In relation to international partnerships, I recently attended Exercise Pitch Black in Darwin, as a guest of the RAAF. Members should be aware that over 20 nations attended this, with over 140 aircraft, and our international partnerships in defence are truly a great asset.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2024 Defence Industry Development Strategy drills down into the defence industry needs to support our future security, including procurement, innovation, workforce and exports. The 2024 Integrated Investment Program outlines our capability investment priorities across land, sea and air as well as the space and cyber fields that the member refers to in his motion. So there is a certain sense in which the member's motion is about two years late.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member's motion acknowledges the work of Senator Jim Molan in the defence sphere, and I add my thanks to the late senator. In the last sittings, the House voted to pass the Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Joint Committee on Defence) Bill 2024. That bill was passed without the vote of the member for Fisher. The coalition opposed the bill on spurious grounds, pretending that it was appropriate to gerrymander the membership of the committee in a way that was arguably both unconstitutional and undemocratic. The member and all of his colleagues know that the membership structure proposed in the legislation for the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Defence is the same as that for the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The coalition are not complaining about that committee now and have not previously, so it is quite clear that they are in fact just playing silly games. I'm sure the member for Fisher, when he reflects on this, can be nothing but embarrassed. While he can't stop the member for Dickson from playing silly games with legislation, he knows we shouldn't see that done with legislation that goes to national security. Let's not beat around the bush: if the Liberals and the Nationals stood up and took national security seriously we could already have a joint committee on defence operating today. That committee would already be reviewing the strategies and documents I've referred to and already be starting to play its important role in helping to keep Australia safe. The fact that it is not done is down to the coalition dragging its feet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've reformed the oversight of the security agencies, and we'll continue that work. We have a minister for cybersecurity in cabinet. We've elevated the importance of critical minerals. We've invested more in border security than the opposition did, and we've done groundbreaking work in both AI and quantum. I welcome any motion in relation to national security, which is the first duty of any federal government. If, however, the member for Fisher wants to move motions like this one, he should first ensure his party isn't the one delaying action in this area. He should get his party to pass the JCOD bill without this ridiculous, spurious delay.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the world doesn't stop for sport, but every four years the Olympic and Paralympic Games give us the opportunity to focus on something outside of our everyday concerns and worries and to feel we're part of something bigger, something special and something noble. The Olympics and Paralympics are multicultural melting pots of elite talent from every corner of the globe, and in less than eight years time Brisbane and Queensland will proudly host these events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Olympics and Paralympics are stages for the ultimate drama. There are charismatic personalities, fascinating backstories, heartwarming displays of sportsmanship, heartbreak when it goes wrong and the joy and celebration of triumph, whether that triumph is making the final, achieving a personal best or even winning gold, silver or bronze. When the games are over we are left with wonderful memories. In the case of Brisbane 2032, memories won't be all we take away from the games. As a member of the Brisbane 2032 board, I can confirm the Brisbane Games will leave a lasting beneficial legacy for not only Brisbane and South-East Queensland but all of Queensland and, in fact, all of the nation. The games are being organised with the new norms of the International Olympic Committee front of mind. The 2032 organisers describe it this way: they're determined to make the games fit into the host city and region, not the other way around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A key part of this is the 2032 legacy strategy, called Elevate 2042. This strategy includes feedback from more than 14,000 submissions during a year of community consultation. This resulted in four focus areas in preparing for the Olympics: health and inclusion, connecting people and places, a better future for our environment and an economy of the future. Brisbane 2032 is being planned accordingly. We're looking at a 20-year pipeline of economic benefits from the games, starting with direct benefits for local businesses by engaging them to update existing infrastructure—part of the new norm for the Olympics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll be in Cairns in a few weeks time—an Olympic city—looking at some of their infrastructure. The games are tipped to create more than 90,000 jobs in Queensland and 120,000 nationally. Businesses in all cities hosting events will benefit—obviously Brisbane but also the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast, Townsville, Cairns and even Sydney and Melbourne. People living in and visiting these cities will benefit for years, including prior to the games, from improved sporting and event venues, more efficient public transport and, in South-East Queensland, increased capacity for road and rail corridors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An expected 3.6 million international visitors are predicted to visit our shores for the games. This will deliver a forecast $4.6 billion boom for tourism in Queensland and $8.5 billion across Australia. It will build upon Australia's image as a safe, politically stable, wonderful destination to visit. There are also social and cultural benefits of hosting the games, like the opportunity to showcase the arts, our musicians, our artists and our performers from high-school level right through to some world-renowned performers. Visitors will be able to immerse themselves in the world's oldest living culture, with First Nations experiences and perspectives throughout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The games are a platform to boost and inspire community participation, an active lifestyle and sport, something I'm particularly passionate about as co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends—or enemies—of Diabetes group. There are plans to promote active travel to events. Brisbane will promote climate-positive events with low-emissions public transport for all athlete movements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is investing $3.5 billion into Brisbane 2032 infrastructure, seizing this generational opportunity to bring forward plan development in time for the games and to leave a lasting legacy for the community afterwards. It's important to note that the Queensland government is working to ensure costs remain within agreed funding levels. Their focus, as it should be, is on the community benefit of being the host city and then 10 years after.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to finish by congratulating the 2024 Olympic Games team members on their fantastic efforts in Paris. I'm looking forward to cheering on the Australian Paralympic team when competition starts on 28 August. The one benefit I haven't mentioned yet is the inspiration these athletes have given young Australians. Many will already be training—in the pool, on the track, on BMX circuits and on courts—and dreaming of emulating the feats of their heroes in eight years time. We look forward to cheering them on in LA and then in Brisbane, Queensland in 2032.</span>

                  </a>  Well, he's had the floor up to date, and he doesn't like me saying that they spat upon Christianity. My friend, you enjoy democracy because the Magna Carta was written by Archbishop Langton. That's who wrote it. Pax Romana was brought to the world by Constantine because he became a Christian. The most brutal regime on earth, Rome, was Christianised and civilised, and I think that's an accurate description.</span>

                  </a>  No. They spat upon Christianity. The six greatest scientists in human history are Pasteur, Newton, Galileo, Einstein, Faraday and Mendel, and all of them were profound Christian believers. Mendel was a monk and Faraday was a preacher of religion. They're the six greatest scientists in human history. Who destroyed communism? It murdered 78 million people, and who destroyed it? Gorbachev. And his first comment to the world was: 'When we go down upon our knees at night we all pray to the same God.' The world that I lived in was different than the world that I was brought up in, with the terror of the atomic bomb threatening us every day of our lives, and it was cured by that great man, Gorbachev, and the Pope of Rome and Charlie Wilson, who were all profound Christians, motivated by Christianity. Who got rid of slavery? We Christians did. Who led the civil rights movement in the United States? We Christians did. I now see it spat upon by this organisation and this organisation being lauded by people in this parliament.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's the little matter of cost. It's a big party for Brisbane. I don't think there are too many people in Brisbane who are anxious about it. No-one else applied for it. No-one else in the world wanted it. Don't skite about getting it, because no-one else in the world wanted it. Unlike most people in this place, I was an Olympic qualifier in long jump. I didn't go; I won't go into that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to come back to the issue of the cost of $30 billion. That's the average cost of the last four Olympic Games, with a little bit of inflation. That's from a budget of $50 billion. What could I do with that $30 billion?  In Far North Queensland we had five deaths on the roads in two weeks and 74 deaths in 14 years. We need a tunnel. Brisbane's got 36 kilometres of tunnels. North Queensland hasn't got one kilometre of tunnel. Brisbane's got 1.2 million people, and we've got a million people.</span>

He's tried to take up all my time, and I can't blame him because I'd hate to be sitting there hearing that the state's going to be up for $30 billion for some fun time for a part of Brisbane whilst the rest of the state pays for it, because most of the state's revenue is coming out of the northern half of the state, where a million people live. We can't even be given one kilometre of tunnel by the city that this man represents. There are 36 kilometres of tunnels in Brisbane. It's the tyranny of the majority.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298840" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:51</span>):  I stand here today as a proud five-time Olympian. There is no greater feeling of pride than representing your country at an Olympic Games in a sport which you have dedicated your entire life to. The only thing that could possibly beat this feeling is being able to do it at a home Olympics. Unfortunately, I didn't get this experience—I just missed out on qualification for the 2000 Sydney Olympics—but I'm incredibly excited for the future crop of athletes who will have the honour and privilege of representing their country on home soil at the 2032 Brisbane Olympic Games.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're a nation that admires and idolises our sporting and Olympic heroes. Our athletes deserve their chance to feel this admiration at a home Olympic Games, and they deserve to have their friends and family supporting them in their own backyard. We've all just witnessed the Olympic Games in Paris. Many of us stayed up until all hours of the night cheering on athletes. The games dominated our TV screens, took over our newspapers and became a part of most conversations with our loved ones and our workmates. There's something truly special about the Olympic Games that unites us and brings together people from all walks of life, regardless of their differences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people deserve the chance to witness iconic Olympic moments right in front of them, to pack the Olympic aquatic centre, the track and field stadium and, hopefully, the shooting range to cheer on athletes to gold medals. Going to the games, let alone winning an Olympic or Paralympic medal, is the stuff that dreams are made of. The best part is that, in 2032, this is all going to happen on home soil. That is why, as a government, we continue to work closely with the Queensland government on the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of benefits that can come from being the host of the Olympic Games, and it's so important that we use the next eight years to make sure that we're able to make the most of these benefits. The social benefits of the games are estimated to be worth $3.5 billion for Queensland and up to $9.1 billion nationally. The economic benefits are going to be huge. By looking at countries who have previously hosted the Olympic Games, we have seen that the international tourism to host cities and the nation as a whole jumps not only during the Olympics and Paralympics, but before and after the games as well. We expect this to be the case in Brisbane as a result of the games in 2032. The games are expected to attract 3.6 million international visitors. The games are also a massive generator of jobs. The games are expected to generate more than 90,000 jobs per year in Queensland and more than 120,000 jobs per year nationally. The 10-year lead-up to and legacy of the games together are forecast to generate increased international tourism and trade, with $4.6 billion for Queensland and $8.5 billion for the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The games are a win for everyone. We are committed to making the 2032 Olympic Games the most successful ever. We want to support athletes to achieve great sporting success through high-performance systems and focus on getting more Aussies up on the podium. We also know that, if the games are going to be a success, we need to make sure we build world-class facilities. That's why we are committing up to $3.4 billion for venue infrastructure projects to support the games. We want to remain the No. 1 supporter of these games by being a funding partner in delivering games venues in time for 2032 to make sure it's an Olympics to remember. I also want to note that the Queensland government is prioritising community benefits whilst ensuring costs remain within the agreed funding envelope of $7.1 billion, to be shared between the state and Commonwealth governments, which is important in making these games successful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">2032 is a long way away, and there's a lot of work to be done. But I'm confident we'll host one of the greatest Olympic Games of our lifetimes. I can't wait for the 2032 Olympic Games. We've heard many newspaper reports and reports on the TV saying that we are behind time. We're this; we're that. We're not going to have the best games ever. Look at Sydney. We had all the naysayers saying the exact same things before the Sydney Olympics. The Sydney Olympics was one of the best Olympics that has ever been held anywhere in the world, and I can guarantee you that Brisbane will be the same. To the naysayers saying this won't happen and that it'll never get there, shame on you. Shame on all of you! We're Australians. We're proud of our sporting success, and we will continue to show our sporting success all the way. Let's get behind the 2032 Olympics and show the world what Aussies can do. Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, oi, oi, oi!</span>

                  <a href="291387" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:56</span>):  How can I possibly follow a speech on the Olympics from an Olympian? It's an impossible task. It can't be done. But I'll give it a go. The member for Hunter does a great job talking up sport in Australia. I agree with his enthusiasm, and I think it's important that we do stand up and congratulate everyone who competed in the Olympic Games, wearing the green and gold. Once you're wearing those colours, you're ours. We get behind them. It has been fantastic to watch that. Like in a lot of families, I sat with my kids, watching a whole range of sports that I will probably never watch again until the next Olympics rolls around. But I think that's part of what it is—giving kids a view of what they can do and achieve, and that's one of the best things about the Olympics. I watched a little bit of shooting. The Turkish shooter certainly drew a bit of attention. I'm not sure how he goes against you, member for Hunter!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to talk about this, because I think there is an important conversation to have about the Olympics, this role it plays in the national psyche and what they do for us as a country. Thinking back to the Sydney Olympics is a great point. Look what it did for us. I think it's right for us to turn towards those 2032 Olympics and really see what we went to get out of it. But I do want to pay some tribute to the people who got that bid off the ground, because people don't remember this. The Brisbane 2032 Olympics was originally the South-East Queensland Olympics.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HAMILTON:</span>
                  </a>  Absolutely, Graeme. I think it's important to point these people out. You know who else it was? It was my former mayor from the Toowoomba Regional Council, Paul Antonio. Paul spoke about this at the Council of Mayors South East Queensland and was laughed at. 'There's no way you can have a regional Olympic Games. There's no way South-East Queensland mayors can get together and pull an Olympics together.' To his credit, when the state government of the day and the federal government weren't confident, Paul and other members from that group, like Graham Quirk representing Brisbane City Council, pushed on. And the Olympic Games morphed, and people started to get behind it. It became, over time, the Brisbane Games. I think it is reasonable. While we're looking forward to it, I think it's important to look back at the people who pursued this idea and got us those games.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the issues we have had and one of the reasons I raise that is that, since that time, the role of South-East Queensland in the games has diminished significantly. I think that's unfortunate, because it was from these regional heartlands that this idea came about. We went through a very difficult conversation about the upgrades for the Toowoomba Sports Ground that were proposed to be part of these Olympics. This was really a substandard offering for the people of Toowoomba. We weren't going to get an actual football game. What we were going to get was a preliminary warm-up game in Toowoomba and, rather than get legacy infrastructure, what we were offered was temporary stands added onto the Toowoomba stadium. To put this in context, what these temporary stands mean is that you don't have to have noise abatement or light abatement—and, unfortunately, this stadium is in the middle of an suburban area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The local residents, quite rightly, raised their concerns about having a temporary structure brought into play. This was a problem. The people of Toowoomba spoke up when Mr Quirk ran his review of Olympic infrastructure, and he came back and removed the Toowoomba stadium from the plan for the 2032 Olympics. That was a good move because the people in and around the stadium did not support it. It had no legacy benefits for the area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now find ourselves having a very direct conversation in Toowoomba with the organisers of the 2032 Olympics about what would actually be legacy infrastructure for our region. What comes back time and time again is the equestrian centre proposal that's been put forward for the showgrounds. Somewhere around 60 per cent of Queensland's thoroughbreds come from my area. Equestrian is a huge sport. Overwhelmingly, it's a sport dominated by women. My sister was one of them. We've seen that change. If you go to a pony club nowadays, it's a sport where women absolutely dominate. This is a great thing. It's something that I think our region can get behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we're reflecting on what was an excellent Olympics for Australia, I hope we can look forward and see that we need that legacy infrastructure coming to regional areas. They're the areas that brought the Olympics to Brisbane. They're the ones that believed in it all the way through. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:04</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion put forward by my friend and colleague, the member for Moreton, this evening. Excitement for Brisbane 2032 is certainly high after the amazing efforts of our sensational Olympians at Paris 2024. In total, over 460 Australian athletes competed for medals in 329 events. Our Olympians gave it their all in Paris and went on to win 53 medals—18 gold, 19 silver and 16 bronze—making Paris our most successful games to date.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take a moment to reflect on the fantastic efforts of team Newcastle at the Paris games. I want to extend a massive congratulations to Newcastle's Jess Hull, who claimed silver in an incredible run in the women's 1,500 metres. She became the first Australian woman to win an Olympic medal at a distance further than 800 metres. Nathan Power, a product of the Hunter Hurricanes water polo team, co-captained the Aussie Sharks, steering the side to the quarterfinals before a loss to the United States sent the Sharks to the classification rounds. The Hockeyroos, with the assistance of South Newcastle striker Mariah Williams, and the Kookaburras, with the help of North Newcastle teammates Matt Dawson and Ky Willott, made it through to the quarterfinals in the women's and men's hockey. Newcastle surfer Tyler Wright's campaign ended in the quarterfinals after a strong debut in her opening rounds. Former Newcastle Jet, Emily van Egmond, and the former Adamstown Rosebud, Clare Wheeler, both featured in the Matildas campaign for gold in the women's football. Local track superstar Rose Davies gave it her all in the women's 5,000 metres and became the first Australian woman to run the distance in under 15 minutes. Reigning women's pentathlon Oceania champion, Newcastle's Genevieve van Rensburg, made her Olympic debut at Paris in the modern pentathlon. Last, but certainly not least, Wallsend's Jacqueline Nichele made her Olympic debut in the 71 kilogram women's weightlifting category.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know I speak on behalf of all Novocastrians when I say we are so proud of you all. You have represented Newcastle and Australia brilliantly, and you can continue to inspire the next generation of local sports men and women. While we celebrate the success and achievements of Olympians, I'd like to remind you the race is only halfway through, with the Paralympic team set to make their debut in Paris at the Paralympics next week. I'd like to give a special shout-out to local superstar Lauren Parker, who will compete at the games for the second time, in the para-triathlon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport plays such an important role in our community, whether it's at the local, regional, state, national or global level. The success of 'team Newcastle' and 'team Australia' at the Paris games has made the excitement ahead of and the anticipation of Brisbane 2032 that much more palpable. For countless kids and young people out there today on fields, on courts, on arenas, on pitches and in the pools, the games are the pinnacle of success. The lead-up to Brisbane 2032 will be used as a platform to boost and inspire more community participation and to promote an inclusive environment where women and girls and Australians of all abilities feel welcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the next eight years we have the opportunity to maximise the benefits of hosting the games. We will support athletes to achieve greater sporting success through a high-performance system focused on achieving enduring podium success. The Australian government is committing up to $3.4 billion dollars towards the Brisbane Olympic Games, which is set to generate billions of dollars in social and economic benefits for not just Brisbane but our entire nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a country which loves sport, and it runs deep in our veins. We know that hosting the Olympic Games in Australia has profoundly positive impacts on the development of local sports and athletes, leaving a legacy that extends well beyond the games. Bring on Brisbane 2032!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263547" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:07</span>):  There has been an overwhelming demand for the Albanese government's Play Our Way program. It's a program that's all about investing in women's sport, and it is the single biggest package for women's sport ever, providing $200 million in funding to help not only our future Olympians, Paralympians, Matildas and Diamonds but also girls and women who just love to compete and play at the local level. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The program has been an amazing success, with many hundreds of clubs applying for the fund. What this shows is that the level of demand for investment in women's sporting facilities and equipment is huge. The number of applications for this fund highlights the level of demand for funding that invests in women's change rooms, equipment and new sporting facilities. But, while demand has been high, with over 1,600 applications from sporting clubs across the nation, our government remains committed to ensuring the department's process is fair, fulsome and respectful of the volunteers who work tirelessly to construct an application. This takes time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While all things take time, the department has already contacted applicants to stream 1 and informed those who are progressing to the next stage of assessment for that stream. Unsuccessful applicants have also been notified. Organisations who applied for the participation and equipment stream of the fund will be provided with an update in the coming weeks. And I can assure my local clubs that their efforts have not gone unnoticed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently held a forum in my electorate of Corangamite to help communities apply for grants. There was much interest in the Play Our Way grant because the growing number of women playing male dominated sports in my region is increasing, and there is a need for better facilities. Sports like football, basketball, soccer and cricket are seeing a massive surge of popularity amongst women in my rapidly growing region. That's what this Play Our Way grant is all about. The program is designed to fund great ideas at a local level and across a range of sports, to increase women's participation. It's an opportunity for local governments, community organisations, the not-for-profit sector and sporting organisations to show how they can create a better sporting landscape for women and girls across the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I should remind the member for Durack that probity and integrity are key parts of the Play Our Way grant process, and the Albanese government is absolutely committed to ensuring the program is well managed. We know it's vital to have a robust process and ensure the best projects receive funding. We want to do this right. We do not want to rely on a colour coded spreadsheet. Again, I want to assure all my local clubs that each application is thoroughly assessed and reviewed to ensure fairness to all applicants and to deliver the best outcomes for women and girls in communities across the country. We want to see grants go to those who need them most, and that's what we're delivering. I look forward to notifying my local clubs on the status of their grant applications very soon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has been made clear is that there is a high demand to provide women and girls with greater opportunities to access, participate in and remain involved in sport and physical activity. The Albanese government recognises this. Too often, women have been changing in men's bathrooms, wearing hand-me-down boys uniforms and playing on poorly maintained fields that boys teams would refuse to play on. We know that too many girls drop out of sport and never come back as adults. Play Our Way will address these issues to help women and girls enjoy sport for life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, we have recently seen a surge in sports participation as more opportunities and choices open up for women and girls. This is increasing participation in sport overall, which is a wonderful thing. Watching so many girls and women getting out and playing footy and cricket has been an absolute joy for me. For me, it's a priority that clubs have the resources to cater for girls and women and to meet current standards and expectations. That's what the Albanese government commitment will deliver, and it's what the Play Our Way program will deliver.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:11</span>):  There's no doubt, not just across the community of Casey but across all communities in Australia, that investing in sports infrastructure, particularly to drive female participation, is so important and so needed. It's something that I've been speaking about for the 2½ years that I've been a member of parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spent my life playing sport in my community. Over the years I've seen the facilities that are not up to standard, but I've also seen the positive impact that those facilities can have. One facility in particular, the Mount Evelyn Recreation Reserve, was recently upgraded, finalised and opened. That was funded in a joint partnership between the federal and state governments and the local council. Tony Smith, the former member for Casey, was a strong advocate and secured that funding. I remember, when I was playing cricket at Healesville against Mount Evelyn, that the club rooms were old and they weren't welcoming. But, when you look at the new clubrooms, they are welcoming and they are fresh. They are revitalising the sporting community in Mount Evelyn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mount Evelyn Football Club has led the way in women's participation in many ways, particularly in AFL, and their junior program is strong. In fact, it is so strong that the Mount Evelyn under-16 girls won their premiership yesterday. I want to send a shout-out to the Mount Evelyn under-16 girls team who won that premiership. I've seen the facilities that they get to enjoy. I know it makes their participation a lot easier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why so many people are frustrated with the delays of the Albanese Labor government and the time it has taken to implement the Play Our Way program. We need to be honest and we need to understand that this announcement was not in the works for the government. They weren't looking to spend any money on female sporting infrastructure until the coalition's $250 million dollar announcement for female sporting community infrastructure across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Prime Minister and the Minister for Sport were happy to attend the soccer and cheer on the Matildas, the coalition was actually putting forward policies to deliver on that momentum that was being built. And what did we see a week or two later? The government announced their own $20 million fund. But we know that the fund was an afterthought for the government, because we saw through Senate estimates and different processes that they rushed through a release to the department asking for a fund to be spun up in a week or two. That was the first time that the department had heard about this program. Again, the coalition is leading the way on policy. It is good the government followed us and announced $200 million—$250 million would have been better—but it's taken over 12 months for anything to happen. Not a dollar has been spent despite that fanfare. As David Peel, the secretary of the Seville Cricket Club and a good friend of mine, said recently in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If we weren't successful in our application, which is fine, we'd rather know so that we can move on with planning … That's probably the frustration with this one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is the frustration for many community groups across my electorate and many other electorates that have got this growth in female sport but don't have the facilities to match—and they're still waiting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was lucky enough to visit two of my old clubs on the weekend: the Monbulk Rangers Soccer Club and Lilydale Montrose United. I've still got a connection to Lilydale Montrose United; my two children, my eight-year-old daughter and my 11-year-old son, play at the club, and I get to referee their games on the weekend when time allows. To see the young boys and young girls running around as equals on the field, enjoying all the benefits of sport—teammates, learning the rules, learning the pain of defeat and the opportunity to grow—is so valuable. That's why we need to continue to invest in female infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a first step but a delayed step. There's more that needs to be done. While I'm the member for Casey I'll continue to advocate for female sports facilities because every person, every young man and every young girl and woman, should be able to go to their club and participate on an equal playing field, and we know facilities make a big difference to that.</span>

                  <a href="295588" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  I'm not surprised to hear it's difficult for those opposite to comprehend a grants scheme with integrity at its heart. But, nonetheless, I am very prepared to talk about women's sport and girls' sports. In fact, one of the very first political acts I ever participated in was in primary school, when I organised a petition in my class for girls to be able to play soccer. This is a cause very close and near and dear to my heart, and I'm proud to be part of a government that wants to see more girls and women participate in sport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were proud to deliver one of Australia's largest and most comprehensive investments in women's sport, with funding and reforms to help more women play sport. This is the single-biggest package for women's sport facilities ever. Play Our Way represents a $200 million fund to help our next Olympians, Paralympians, Matildas, Diamonds and so many more athletes. I know how passionate my own local community in Chisholm is about this. They are passionate about equality in sport and promoting girls' and women's participation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that existing projects that I've been working on and advocating for will enhance women's and girls' participation through dedicated infrastructure. It was not too long ago that I had the privilege of turning the sod for a new pavilion at Mount Waverley Reserve. I'm looking forward to seeing that project for the football, netball and cricket club advance; it is a vital piece of community infrastructure that will mean facilities for girls and women and will further encourage their participation in sport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community knows how important Play Our Way is. We know that too often women and girls are changing in men's bathrooms or in their cars, wearing hand-me-down boys' uniforms and playing with men's equipment on poor fields that people would never let the boys play on. Too many girls drop out of sport and never come back as women; that's a particular issue with girls as they reach their teenage years. Play Our Way will address these issues to help women and girls enjoy sport for life. The Play Our Way grant program is robust and meticulous by design. We want to help clubs address participation barriers faced by women and girls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This program was designed by experts to deliver excellent outcomes with lasting positive impacts on a wide range of communities, funding great ideas at a local level and across a range of different sports. This is a wonderful opportunity for local governments, community organisations and the not-for-profit sector and sporting organisations to show how they can create a better sporting landscape for women and girls across the country, and that's what we want to do—create a landscape for women and girls to participate in sport. Part of this is ensuring that the grant process has integrity. I'm really disappointed that the coalition have seemingly learned nothing from their awful sports rorts debacle, where they funded women's facilities for clubs that didn't even have women's teams, simply because they thought it was politically advantageous. I have to say that, when I was elected, I was really shocked when I saw locally the extent to which grants were mishandled. I heard from a number of clubs—and this was really difficult to hear—who were misled and were told things that were not true about their grant applications. They believed that there had been money budgeted and allocated to them by the previous government, and this proved to be false, and there was absolutely no record of paperwork. This is really appalling and so damaging to the community. When you hear stories like this, you understand why people do not have much faith in politicians at times. I will never behave in such a cynical way, and I absolutely believe that there must be integrity, transparency and accountability in grant programs such as this. I don't apologise for that. This is taxpayer money after all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am really pleased that we have received more than 1,600 applications from all over Australia for the Play Our Way grants. They are being assessed in the way that I think taxpayers would expect them to be. I'm so pleased to be part of a government that takes girls' and women's sport seriously and takes our responsibility to taxpayers seriously. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

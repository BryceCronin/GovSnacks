# GovSnacks

GovSnacks is an experimental AI tool for transforming copious [Australian Parliament House Harsard reports](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard) into easy-digestible bite-sized “snacks” that focus on a specified issue of interest, such as disability rights, gender equity, or migration.


This project was created by Bryce Cronin for GovHack 2024, you can read more on the [GovHack Hackerspace](https://hackerspace.govhack.org/projects/govsnacks).

## Running GovSnacks
- Run Main.py in your favourite Python IDE.
- You'll need to provide your own OpenAI API key in the 'advanced' settings page.

## What's next
- In this demo, only the latest week of Handard reports are available. A future update will add automatic retrieval of the latest reports for summarisation.
